Abstract

Identifying arrhythmias from electrocardiogram(ECG)
signals remains an intractable challenge. This study aims
to develop an effective and non-invasive approach to
realize the recognition of arrhythmias based on 12-lead
ECG for the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge2020. To this end, we propose a deep learningbased diagnosis approach, called EASTNet which
captures the characteristics of cardiac abnormalities and
correlation between heartbeats sampled randomly from
12-lead ECG records by a 34-layer 1D-deep squeezeand-excitation network. Experimenting in the multi-label
arrhythmia classification task, our team, EASTBLUE,
was unable to rank and score in the hidden validation
and test sets, but achieved diagnostic performance with
0.7030 ± 0.0090 metric score using 5-fold crossvalidation on the training set. We also investigate the
effect of beat sampling on diagnostic performance, and
find that the beat sampling plays a role in data
augmentation that effectively alleviates network
overfitting. These results demonstrate that our approach
has good potential application prospects in clinical
practice, especially in the auxiliary diagnosis of
abnormalities.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, cardiac
abnormalities are the leading cause of death globally: they
kill more people each year than any other cause of death.
Cardiac abnormality is a kind of common circulatory
system disease, which includes atrial fibrillation,
premature beat and other arrhythmias. These symptoms
are usually examined and classified clinically by means
of non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG). Among them,
12-lead ECG is the gold standard in diagnosing
cardiovascular abnormalities, which can more accurately
capture abnormalities and timely identify various
cardiovascular abnormalities. In view of the large amount
of data collected and analyzed by 12-lead dynamic ECG

examination, automatic ECG classification algorithm is
required to be both accurate and fast, which is also the
focus of our study. The PhysioNet/Computing in
Cardiology Challenge2020 focus on intelligent diagnosis
of 12-lead ECG[1].
Before this, a variety of machine learning and data
processing methods have been used to improve the
accuracy of ECG detection. In[2], the author proposed a
method of ECG signal classification combining wavelet
transform and decision tree classification, and used MITBIH arrhythmia database as ECG signals for
classification. Finally, the accuracy of the system reached
96.31%. In[3], the author proposed an automatic
arrhythmia classification system based on Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). The experimental results showed
that the classification accuracy is 86.67%. In[4],a 34-layer
deep neural network was trained to classify 12 rhythm
classes with 91,232 single-lead ECGs and achieved a
better result than cardiologists.

In our paper, we develop a novel deep residual
network (ResNet) [5] with multi-layer perceptron [6]
and 1D-Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [7] architectures.
The experiments show our method is able to achieve high
challenge score on training set. Figure 1 is the framework
for the proposed system.

Methods

Currently, the popular method is to directly learn the
entire ECG signal or to learn with a single heartbeat after
the heartbeat is intercepted. However, such a method has
the problems of low learning efficiency, low data

utilization and data imbalance.
In response to the above problems, we propose a data
enhancement method for heartbeat sampling. Specifically,
we first intercept a single heartbeat, and then combine the
heartbeats in a random manner. After experimentation,
we select four heartbeats as input, and finally achieve
outstanding results. The advantage of this is that we
effectively solve the problem of data imbalance, allowing
the network to fully learn the characteristics of each
cardiac abnormalities. At the same time, our data volume
has also been significantly enhanced so that we can well
solve the problem of model overfitting. In addition, our
method combines the characteristics of multiple
heartbeats to make the judgment of the model more
comprehensive and accurate.

Dataset

Since our team EASTBLUE failed to score and rank
on the hidden validation and test sets, we had to use the 5fold cross-validation method on the training set to test our
model. First of all, we take the removal of erroneous and
unnecessary data as the first step in data processing. In
addition, we collect statistics on the patient data of each
cardiac abnormalities and then selectively discard and
copy, so as to balance the data distribution as much as
possible. Finally, we get 6720 valid records with 201600
heartbeats.

certain length in the front and back, the heartbeat can be
intercepted for use in the following algorithm. After the
heartbeat is intercepted, we can resample processed signal
by resample function. Finally, we get some records with a
sampling point of 300 as the Figure 4 shows.

Firstly, after eliminating baseline drift, we filter the
original ECG signals (Figure 2) by 3~45 Hz finite
impulse response band-pass filter. Then we obtain the
position of the R peak in the lead record by R-peak[8]
detection (Figure 3).Finally according to the specific
position of the R peak in a given signal, extending a

Figure 5. The architecture of the proposed method
The structure of the proposed network is shown in
Figure 5. The proposed approach can be divided into two
main modules from the top to down: feature encoder

module which we introduce 1D-Squeeze-and-Excitation
block on the basis of 1D-ResNet and Multi-layer
Perceptron (MLP) module. The first module is used to
extract the features of ECG signals. The last MLP module,
maps the learned feature representation in ECG domain to
predict the cardiac abnormalities.

Feature Encoder

During the clinical diagnosis of cardiac problems, the
interpretations of 12-lead ECG signals by medical
workers mostly depends on its local characteristics, such
as PR Interval or T-Wave duration, and P-Wave flag and
so on. Inspired by this, we choose ResNet as the base
model due to its good performance in feature extraction.
ResNet has proven to be very successful in the image
field. We modify the original two-dimensional network
structure to one-dimensional so that it can be well adapted
to our task of ECG classification. In order to better fit the
characteristics of the ECG signals, we increase the size of
the first convolution kernel to 15 to greatly increase its
receptive field, then we add a convolutional layer with a
convolution kernel size of 7x7 to obtain information at
different scales. As we all know, the maximum pooling
layer will cause the loss of spatial information, and it
cannot take the relationship between multiple channels
into account, so we cancel the maximum pooling layer
and replace it with a convolutional layer. Meanwhile, we
also add a series of dropout layers to enhance the
robustness of the network.

Squeeze and Excitation block

In medicine, there is a certain relationship between 12
leads. Doctors can roughly make judgments about certain
abnormalities based on the images of specific leads. So
we want to pay attention to the relationship between each
lead, the model can automatically learn the importance of
different channels. We want to capture the importance of
each feature channel by enabling the machine to learn
autonomously. Therefore we embed the 1D-Squeeze-andExcitation block in our basic block to learn hidden
features between different leads. As we all know,
convolution will get the feature map. The SE module first
squeezes this feature map to obtain channel-level global
features. After the excitation of the global features, the
relationship between each channel will be determined by
the SE module, so that the weight of different channels
will be determined. The final feature can be obtained by
multiplying the weight by the original feature map. In
essence, the SE module performs attention or gating
operations in the channel dimension, which is conducive
to channel features with the largest amount of information
to get the most attention and is helpful to ignore the
unimportant channel features.

Experimental Results

Challenge Score

We compare the proposed model with several
alternatives, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)[9]
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)[10]. For fairness,
we only replace the model part in the complete code
without changing anything else. The experimental results
are presented in Table 1, which involves the challenge
scores.

As shown in Table 1, the proposed model get a
challenge score of 0.7030 ± 0.0090.Although both SVM
and LSTM are state-of-the-art methods, the experimental
results indicate that they fail to perform as well as our
model under the same conditions.

Comparison Experiment

In this part, we focus on the impact of our data
processing methods. After intercepting a single heartbeat,
we think that the number of heartbeats entered is a very
worthy question. Intuitively speaking, a large number of
heartbeats will introduce more noise and more invalid
information, which will lead to difficulties in network
learning, but a small number of heartbeats cannot fully
reflect the characteristics of all abnormalities. There is a
whole versus part relationship here. Therefore, we need
to explore the most suitable number of heartbeats. At the
same time, continuous heartbeats and random heartbeats
are also part of our comparative experiment. The final
experimental results are shown in the Table 2 and Table 3
below.

In addition, in order to test the robust performance of
our model, we also design a comparison experiment that
use different k-fold cross-validation which k = 3,4,5. The
result is shown in the Table 4. We can see that our model
performs well on robustness.

Conclusion

In this experiment, EASTNet is proposed to diagnose
cardiac abnormalities with the aid of 12-lead ECG only.
The proposed method combines local-encoder and the
relationship between 12-leads to obtain a better feature
representation of ECG records. It is a end-to-end model
that doesn’t need other additional information like
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed
Tomography (CT).
From the Table 2 and Table 3, the score of the model is
the highest when the number of random heartbeats is five,
but we have a trade-off between score and computational
complexity, so we choose four random heartbeats as our
input. Too few heartbeats will lead to insufficient
effective features and too many heartbeats will introduce
some noise and invalid information, which will make
model learning difficult. So finding the best number of
random heartbeats is the key to improve the challenge
score.
In the future, there are two potential directions worth
exploring. Firstly, we will explore in more depth the
performance of different abnormalities under the same
heartbeat and the impact of different heartbeat capture
methods on the model. Another potential direction that
we want to study is to combine our model with the model
suitable for extracting the signal characteristics of time
series, which is beneficial to obtain more useful
information from ECG signals.
