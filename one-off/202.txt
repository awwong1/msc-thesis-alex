Abstract
Background: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is
a standard tool used in medical practice for identifying
cardiac abnormalities. The 2020 PhysioNet/Computing in
Cardiology Challenge addresses the topic of automated
classification of 12-lead ECG. Methods: Two machine
learning strategies were implemented: a feature engineering approach based on the engineering of physiological
features (or “digital biomarkers”) and a deep learning approach. Two sets of features were engineered: (1) capturing the interval variation between consecutive heartbeats, commonly called heart rate variability (HRV) measures and (2) using morphological biomarkers (e.g. QT
interval, QRS width). A total of 16 HRV and 97 morphological biomarkers were implemented in python for each
lead. A random forest (RF) model was trained using 5-fold
cross validation to optimize the model hyperparameters.
For the deep learning approach, a residual neural network
(ResNet) architecture was used. The RF and ResNet were
also combined in an ensemble learning (EL). The dataset
was divided into 80%-20% stratified training-test sets. Results: on the local test set we achieved a Challenge score of
0.65 using the FE approach, 0.52 using the DL approach
and 0.66 using the EL approach. For technical reasons
we did not manage to score our models on the Challenge
hidden test set.

Introduction

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive representation of the electrical activity of the heart. It is measured using electrodes placed on the surface of the torso.
The standard 12-lead ECG has been widely used to diagnose a variety of cardiac abnormalities such as cardiac
arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. The early and
correct diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities can increase the
chances of successful treatments. However, manual interpretation of the electrocardiogram is time-consuming, and

requires skilled personnel with a high degree of training.
Automatic detection and classification of cardiac abnormalities can assist physicians in performing an accurate
diagnosis. The 2020 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge [1] addresses the topic of automated classification of 12-lead ECG.

Methods

In this work we evaluate two machine learning (ML)
strategies. The first is a feature engineering (FE) based ML
approach that captures known patterns in the physiological
time series thus mimicking the cardiologist’s approach to
12-lead ECG analysis. The second is a deep learning (DL)
approach that may capture features beyond the traditional
ones. Finally, we combine both approaches within an Ensemble Learning (EL) model. A general overview of the
individual and the combined approaches is shown in Figure 1.
Signal pre-processing: Similar to the work of Zheng et
al. [2], we performed a validation step to detect examples where electrodes were switched. In these instances
we inverted their polarity. The signal quality was estimated
using the bSQI index [3, 4]. Examples with a low signal
quality (bSQI < 0.8) were discarded. Recordings had different sampling rates (f s) across databases (Table 1). We
resampled all the databases to f s = 500Hz. ECGs were
pre-filtered with a Butterworth band-pass filter in order to
filter out baseline wander and high-frequency noise. A low
cutoff frequency at 0.13Hz and a high cut-off frequency at
88Hz were used. Two Notch filters, with cut-off frequencies at 50Hz and 60Hz respectively were used to remove
power-line interference noise.
Databases: The Challenge dataset was composed of
6 databases (Table 1). We split the long ECGs recordings from the INCART database into independent 10-sec
12-lead ECGs, thus totalling 13500 10-sec examples. In
order to augment the number of training examples, external open-access databases were used. The first one,
from Zhang et al. [2] recorded at the Chapman Univer-

sity and Shaoxing People’s Hospital, denoted ”CUSPH”
contains 10646 examples. The second, by Zheng et al.
[5] recorded at the Chapman University and Ningbo First
Hospital, denoted “CUNFH”, is mostly composed of premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and contains 334
examples. A total of 27 classes were considered in the
Challenge among which 26 cardiac abnormalities and normal sinus rhythm (SNR). All examples that had no label
among the 27 classes considered were excluded because
these were not scored by the Challenge performance measure. This resulted in n=53730 examples (Table 1). Three
pairs of classes were considered strictly equivalent by the
Challenge scoring system: CRBBB with RBBB, PVC with
VPB and PAC with SVPB. In summary, we considered a
24 multilabel classification problem.

Feature engineering approach

Waveform analysis and features extraction: Fiducial
points on the ECG waveform were extracted using the
open source wavedet algorithm by Martı́nez et al. [6].
QRS complex, P-wave and T-wave delineations were obtained by applying wavedet to a representative ECG cycle [7] for each lead. The QRS duration and frequency
morphology distortion were extracted to capture premature atrial and ventricular contractions and bundle branch
blocks, [8], [9], [10], [11]. Atrioventricular block were
detected through the statistical analysis of the PR interval [12]. A total of 113 morphological biomarkers were
engineered for each lead or their vectorcardiogram representation [13]. HRV features implemented in Chocron et
al. [14] were used. Finally age and sex were included.
Features were standardized by subtracting the mean and
dividing by the standard deviation.
Machine learning strategy: The database was divided
between training and test sets following a 80%-20% split.
Figure 2 shows the class distribution for the training and
test sets. Of note, for the purpose of producing this figure,
an example with multiple labels was virtually considered
as a count of +1 for each of the class with a positive label. 5-fold cross validation was used for hyperparameters
tuning. To address the multilabel classification challenge,
we used a one versus the rest approach, first by training a
classifier for SNR against the rest, then by training another
23 different classifiers for each cardiac abnormality against
all other abnormalities (but not SNR). The minority classes
were proportionally over-weighted to account for the imbalance of the classes. Feature selection was performed in
order to prevent overfitting and ensures the model’s generalization. Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance
(mRMR) [15] was used and subsequently, a floating recursive feature addition (RFA) algorithm was used. The feature selection was stopped when the Challenge score did
not improve significantly on the average validation set Fβ
score. For each cardiac abnormality we selected the decision threshold that maximized the average Fβ score for
this class on the validation sets.

Deep learning approach

The same preprocessing as for the feature engineering
approach was used. Two deep learning (DL) networks
were trained: the first network is a binary classifier for
SNR against the rest. The second network is used to
classify for any of the 23 cardiac abnormalities using a
multi-head model. Padding was performed, to the constant
length of 40000 samples (i.e. 80 seconds at fs=500Hz).
The feature extraction part of both networks is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Each CNN cell
was composed of: Conv1d, BatchNorm, ReLu, Conv1d,

Figure 2. 80%/20% Training/Testing split with augmenting databases highlighted.
BatchNorm, ReLu, MaxPool, Dropout. The network was
trained with shortcut connections to avoid vanishing gradients. A total of 8 CNN cells were used, with shortcuts
every 2 cells, followed by a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
cell. The GRU takes as input a total of 1250 features produced by the CNN. A multi-head model was used, which
means a fully connected layer for each of the 23 cardiac abnormality. Stratified 5-fold cross validation validation was
performed to find the best hyperparameters of the model.
A combination of two losses was used: BCEWithLogitsLoss, and the F-Beta score. The weight of each loss was
considered a hyperparameter of the model. The Adam optimizer was used.

In order to combine the strengths of the FE and the DL
approaches an EL model was evaluated. It consisted in
adding a logistic regression unit taking as the input the
probability outputs of the FE and DL models.

Results

Signal quality evaluation using bSQI excluded a total
of 3213 examples including 2647 from the Challenge original dataset and 566 from the additional databases. A total
of 140 features were selected (Figure 3) out of the 1360
features computed for each example. The results of the
hyperparameter tuning for the one versus the rest RF classifier were: 750 estimators and a max depth of 70. The
results for each of the three models are reported in Table
3, for the 5-fold cross validation and the local test set. For
technical reasons we did not manage to score our models
on the Challenge hidden test set.

Discussion and conclusion

In our experiment the FE approach outperformed the DL
approach. The EL approach did not improved significantly
the results over the FE approach alone. However, by improving further our DL performance we expect that the
EL approach will significantly improve over the individ-

ual models.
Among the five lowest Fβ scores, four (namely Brady,
LQRSV, PR and LPR) had less than 500 examples in the
training set (Figure 2). This suggests that augmenting the
number of examples in these classes will likely improve
the performance of the model for these classes.
Among the features selected in the FE approach, the
most relevant features were: cosEn, SD1, AFEv, OriginCount, PACEV and IRmax for the HRV features and Dqrsmax, Dqrsmean, Dqrsmed, Dqrsstd (which relate to QRS
duration for PAC, PVC and Bundle Branch Blocks) for the
morphological biomarkers.
