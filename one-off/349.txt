Abstract
Cardiac arrhythmia is a group of conditions in which
falls changes in the heartbeat. Electrocardiography (ECG)
is the most common tool used to identify a pathology in the
cardiac electrical conduction system. ECG analysis is
usually manually performed by an expert physician.
However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and
challenging even for cardiologists. Many automatic
algorithms relying on handcrafted features and traditional
machine learning classifiers were developed to recognize
cardiac diseases. However, a large a priori knowledge
about ECG signals is exploited. To overcome this main
limitation and provide higher performance, recently, deep
neural networks were designed and applied for 12-lead
ECG classification. In this study, we designed decoding
workflows based on three state-of-the-art architectures for
time series classification. These were InceptionTime,
ResNet and XResNet. Experiments were conducted using
the
training
datasets
provided
during
the
PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. The
best-performing algorithm was based on InceptionTime,
scoring a training 5-fold cross-validation challenge metric
of 0.5183¬±0.0016, while using a low number of parameters
(510491 in total). Thus, this algorithm provided the best
compromise between performance and complexity.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death,
responsible for the 31% of the worldwide deaths in 2016
[1] and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common
used tool in their diagnoses by non-invasively recording
the electrical activity of the heart. Twelve-lead ECG
describes the activity from 12 sites, each lead containing
features potentially related to a specific arrhythmia. ECG
analysis is usually manually performed by an expert
physician. However, manual interpretation is timeconsuming and challenging [2] and these difficulties
promoted the development of automatic ECG
interpretation algorithms.
Automatic algorithms relying on handcrafted features

(e.g. statistical features, frequency-domain features, timedomain features) and traditional machine learning
classifiers were developed to recognize cardiac diseases.
However, a large a priori knowledge about characteristics
of the signals is exploited and separate feature extraction,
selection and classification steps are performed. Lastly,
these classic algorithms are limited in performance [3],
precluding their usage as a standalone diagnostic tool.
Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) were designed
and applied to electrophysiological signals [4-7]. This
provided an end-to-end framework where the most
relevant features are automatically learned directly from
raw/lightly pre-processed data without separately perform
feature extraction and classification. When applied to ECG
signals [8-10], this enabled statements that resulted highly
difficult to make even for cardiologists [11]. Among
DNNs, recently Strodthoff et al. [10] reported outstanding
results using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
such as InceptionTime [12], ResNet [13] and XResNets
[14], on a large public benchmark dataset.
In occasion of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge 2020 [15], challengers had to build an algorithm
to automatically identify the cardiac abnormality /
abnormalities among 27 conditions (see Table 1 for the full
list of the statements) from 12-lead ECG recordings across
6 different datasets.
To this aim, we participated to the competition as
CardioUniBo team and implemented decoding workflows
based on InceptionTime, ResNet and XResNets,
evaluating their performance on the target decoding task.

Methods

In the following sections, the datasets, pre-processing
procedure, and decoding algorithms are described.
Experiments were GPU-accelerated via a NVIDIA Titan V
and PyTorch was used as framework to build and solve the
optimization of the CNNs.

2.1.

Datasets

Among the 6 datasets provided by the organizers of the
PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020, we

considered signals from the China Physiological Signal
Challenge in 2018 sets named CPSC, CPSC-EXTRA
(6877+3453 examples) [16], from the Physikalisch
Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) set named PTB-XL
(21837 examples) [17] and from the unique set recorded in
the Southeastern United States named GEORGIA (10344
examples).
These datasets were selected because resulted the most
representative for the target 27 diagnosis and exhibits
comparable recording lengths (CPSC and CPSC-EXTRA
from 6 to 60 s, while PTB-XL and GEORGIA of 10 s).
Each example can be associated with a one or more
statements (multi-label classification). The statement
distributions of these datasets are reported in Table 1.

standardized.
The downsampled signals resulting from the 4 datasets
were augmented by adopting 2 different procedures. At
first, we extracted consecutive 2.5 s chunks from each 12lead ECG signal without overlap (resulting in an offline
augmentation). Therefore, these chunks of 12-lead ECG
represented the CNN input with shape of (12,250). This
also allowed to keep limited the input time dimension and,
thus, keep controlled the number of trainable parameters in
the convolutional-to-dense transition. Furthermore, due to
the presence of 12-lead ECGs with some leads set to zero
in the datasets, during the optimization of the decoders,
each lead signal was randomly set to zero with a
probability of 0.5 (online augmentation) to give more

Pre-processing

Twelve-lead ECG signals were collected, and the gain
factor was divided for each lead. Then, a zero-phase 2nd
order band-pass Butterworth filter was applied between 0.5
and 40 Hz. Lastly, signals were downsampled to 100 Hz to
reduce the computational cost and each lead signal was

robustness to the algorithms when handling 12-lead ECGs
with zeroed derivations.
Once pre-processed, the datasets were merged together
in a multicenter dataset (42511 total examples) with single
or multiple statements associated to each 12-lead ECG
data. Five-fold stratified cross-validation was performed
and, since our team was unable to obtain the scores on the
test set during the official phase of the challenge, the
evaluation metrics reported in this study correspond to

training cross-validation scores.

2.2.

Decoding

To solve the objective decoding task, InceptionTime
[12], a ResNet-based architecture proposed by Wang et al.
[13] specifically for time series classification (here referred
as ‚ÄúResNet‚Äù for simplicity) and XResNets [14] with 18, 34,
50, 101 layers, were tested. For each of these architecture
designs, the hyper-parameters of the convolutional module
were set as in the original papers. A kernel size of 5 was
used in the 1-D convolutions in ResNet and XResNets,
while kernel sizes of 40, 20 and 10 were used in each
Inception block (6 in total) of InceptionTime as in the
original paper [12].
On top of the convolutional module a concat-pooling
layer was used (concatenation of the output obtained with
global average and max poolings) as was done in
Strodthoff et al. [10]. In addition, all the re-implemented
CNN architectures shared the same dense module,
implemented as a first fully-connected layer with 128 units
followed by batch normalization, ReLU non-linearity and
dropout (ùëù = 0.5), and a second fully-connected layer with
27 units (output layer) activated with sigmoid functions.
The total number of trainable parameters introduced was
510491, 476187, 697499, 1356955, 1808795, 3645339,
respectively for InceptionTime, ResNet and XResNets
with 18, 34, 50, 101 layers.
Cross-entropy was used as loss function and Adam as
optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and a batch size of
32. While training the architectures with a maximum
number of 100 epochs, early stopping was performed
(setting the validation set as the 20% of the training set)
using the validation loss as stop metric.
Once the trainings ended, for each 12-lead ECG
recording the chunk-level probabilities were averaged
together for the chunks belonging to the same recording,
obtaining recording-level probabilities (from crop-level to
recording-level probabilities). Then, these probabilities
were binarized into the predicted statement/statements
using a threshold of 0.5 for each output neuron. When the
prediction was empty (i.e. no output probability exceeded
the threshold set to 0.5), the most probable statement was
selected.
To evaluate the CNNs, we computed the metric
specifically designed for this challenge (here denoted as
‚Äúchallenge metric‚Äù) [15] and the Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristics (AUROC).

All the experiments were conducted on the training
datasets released, obtaining an average training crossvalidation challenge metric above 0.50 in all cases. The
obtained training cross-validated challenge scores were
similar across the architectures, scoring a higher average
value with InceptionTime.

Discussion and Conclusion

In this study, we designed decoding workflows based
on three state-of-the-art CNN designs for time series
classification and applied them to the multicenter ECG
signals provided for the PhysioNet/Computing in
Cardiology Challenge 2020.
From our experiments, InceptionTime resulted the
architecture with higher training cross-validated challenge
metric (on average 0.5183) and with less variability, while
ResNet scored higher training cross-validation AUROC
(on average 0.9400). Together with ResNet,
InceptionTime introduced a lower total number of
trainable parameters (510491 in total) compared to the
other designs, resulting in a more parsimonious neural
network.
Indeed,
comparable
performance
to
InceptionTime were achieved only with XResNet1d (50)
using more than 2x trainable parameters. Therefore,
InceptionTime resulted the best compromise between
performance and complexity, which could be useful to
design models less prone to overfit less-represented
conditions (e.g. in particular the condition ‚ÄúPremature
ventricular contractions‚Äù represented only with 188
examples).
Despite these promising results obtained using CNNs
on multicenter ECG signals, these algorithms suffer from
limited interpretability of the learned features. Future
developments could include designing more explicable
architectures by adding interpretable layers [6] (layers that,
once trained, allow a direct interpretation of the learned
features) and designing even more optimized (in terms of
trainable parameters) architectures than InceptionTime.
