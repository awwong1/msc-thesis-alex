Abstract

Cardiovascular diseases have become the leading
cause of illness and death worldwide. Due to their
chronic nature, early screening and follow-up
management will effectively improve the prevention and
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, where automatic
electrocardiogram (ECG) classification will play an
important role. In this work, we take part in the 2020
PhysioNet - CinC Challenge (in the team ECGMaster)
and propose a novel multi-label classifier of 12-lead ECG
recordings which combines a residual convolutional
network (residual CNN) with a class-wise attention
mechanism. To deal with the problem of data imbalance
between classes, we utilize a novel weighted focal loss in
the training of our models. Our models were trained and
tested in a 5-fold cross validation on the training data
with resulting scores of 0.5501 ± 0.0223 according to the
challenge metric, demonstrating a promising method for
the classification of ECGs. We note that we were unable
to score and rank our model on the official test data, the
results were obtained on the training set only and may be
over-optimistic.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases, on behalf of a number of
abnormal heart conditions, have been regard as the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the
world [1]. The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
is the most commonly used diagnostic tool for the
cardiovascular diseases. Up to now, the treatment of ECG
still relies on manual interpretation, which is timeconsuming and error-prone. In addition, the

miniaturization and portability of ECG devices have been
inducing the rapid growth of recording volume. In
consequence, automatic detection and classification of
ECG abnormalities is very necessary to reduce the
working pressure of physicians and improve the accuracy
of diagnosis.
Although the study on algorithms for automatic ECG
analysis has been going on for several decades, it is still a
challenging work to accurately detect and identify each
abnormality in an ECG recording. The difficulty mainly
lies in the diversity (up to hundreds) of abnormal types
and the high variability of ECG signal. The ECG signal
measured on the body surface is a reflection of the
electrical activities of millions of individual cells in the
heart, thus conveys diagnostic information about the
condition of the heart. However, besides the cardiac
electrical activity, many other factors can affect the
morphology of the ECG waveform, including anatomical
structure [2] and conductivity of the body [3], respiration
[4] and skeletal muscle movement [5], electrode
placement [6], and electromagnetic noise in the
environment [7]. All these factors bring difficulties to the
interpretation of electrocardiogram, and even skilled
experts can differ significantly in their interpretation of
certain ECG records.
Because of the huge complexity of ECG classification,
it is impractical to directly translate human knowledge
into algorithms. As a result, data-driven methods,
especially machine learning methods, have become the
mainstream in this field in recent years. A machine
learning algorithm for ECG classification typically
consists of three steps: preprocessing, feature extraction
and classification. In the preprocessing, noise suppression
and data transformation methods are usually applied to
reduce noise interference and enhance the recognisability

In this work, we adopt the deep learning methodology
to deal with the problem of multi-label classification of
12-lead ECG. The raw ECG signal is first preprocessed to
remove baseline wanders and some other noises. Then, a
novel neural network combining a residual CNN and a
class-wise attention mechanism is proposed to extract
features automatically and detect the existence of each
type of heart condition. In addition, in order to address
the data imbalance problem, we propose a novel weighted
focal loss for the model training.

In the preprocessing stage, the raw ECG signals are
first scaled into the same amplitude resolution (1000/mV)
and resampled to 250Hz. Then, we utilize moving
average filter with a window size of 250 to estimate the
baseline wander and subtract it from the signal. The other
noises, such as muscle movement and environmental
noises, are suppressed by wavelet denoising based on 3level ‘db4’ wavelet transform and soft-thresholding. For
easy of batch processing during the model training, the
recordings are truncated or padded with zeros to the same
length (60 seconds in our experiments) in a random
manner as stated in our previous study [12].

of the patterns [8, 9]. Then, features are extracted from
the preproessed data and are used for the final
classification. Traditionally, the feature extraction and
classification are implemented separately with different
methods [10, 11]. However, the deep learning method
incorporates these two parts into a unified end-to-end
neural network [12].
In this study, we try to deal with the problem of multilabel classification of 12-lead ECG based on the dataset
of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020
[13], which incorporates ECG data from six databases
collected by 4 different institutions. The public available
training set includes a total of 43101 ECG recordings
with 111 types of labels of which 24 types are for scored.
Each record is labelled as one or several categories, with
the distribution of label numbers shown in Figure 1. In
addition, this dataset is extremely imbalanced with 20846
samples for the biggest category (normal sinus rhythm,
NSR) and only 188 samples for the smallest category
(premature ventricular contraction, PVC). Therefore, this
dataset provides rich data, and at the same time
effectively reflects the challenges of automatic ECG
classification in practice, so it is of great research value.
In the following sections, we will describe in detail our
approaches to these challenges along with the
experimental results.

CNN part consisting of 9 residual blocks is used to
extract features from the input ECG signal. Each residual
block contains 2 convolutional layers each with three
other assistant layers (batch normalization, dropout and
ReLU activation). The output of the second convolutional
layer is merged with the block input by addition and
down-sampled by a max-pooling layer to half of the input
length. Each convolutional layer in the first block
contains 32 filters each with a kernel size of 32. As the
network goes deep, for every three residual blocks, the
filter number grows by 32, while the kernel size is
reduced by half. In consequence, the last (or 9th) block
has 96 filters with kernel size of 8 in each of its
convolutional layer.
The residual CNN output a feature map describing the
features of different part of input ECG signal. To make a
diagnostic on the whole signal, we need to aggregate the
local features into a global feature vector. In this network,
we utilize an attention mechanism to do this work. As our
model aims to deal with multi-label classification, and
different parts of an ECG signal may contains features
relevant to different classes, the attention mechanism in
our network is designed to be class-wise to harmonize
the divergence of attentions between different classes. We
will present the class-wise attention in the next subsection.
The class-wise attention part generates an individual
feature vector for each class, which is then fed into a fully
connected layer with sigmoid as the activation function to
predict the probability of the corresponding condition in
the input signal.

2.3.

Class-wise attention

The class-wise attention is based on the scaled dotproduct attention proposed by [14] whose input includes
three parts: query vectors (Q), key vectors (K) and value
vectors (V). The output of the attention layer is a set of
feature vectors (F) which is one-to-one with the queries.
In the setting of multi-label ECG classification, we use
the one-hot encoding of the classes as Q. The K is linearly
transformed from the local features in the extracted
feature map, and have the same last dimension as the Q.
The local features themselves are directly used as V.
Therefore, we get the class-wise attention as follows:
𝐹 = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄(𝑊 𝑇 𝑉 𝑇 + 𝑏))𝑉

(1)

where W is the weights of linear transformation, b is the
bias. Based on this mechanism, the network can learn
specific attention for each class and avoid the conflicts
between different classes.

2.4.

Weighted focal loss

One of the main challenges to train an effective ECG

classifier is the data imbalance of the training set. When
training a DNN model with extremely imbalanced dataset,
the instance-rich classes are prone to dominate the
training procedure, leading to significantly worse
performance for instance-scarce classes. To handle this
challenge, data resampling and loss reweighting are the
mostly common used strategies. In this work, we adopt a
loss reweighting strategy by extending the focal loss
method, an influential approach in field of pattern
recognition [15]. We assign different weights to the final
activations during the loss computation according to the
frequencies of the corresponding classes. The loss
function is as follows:
𝐿(𝑝𝑖 ) = {

−𝛼𝑖,0 𝑝𝑖 𝑟 log(1 − 𝑝𝑖 )
−𝛼𝑖,1 (1 − 𝑝𝑖 )𝑟 log(𝑝𝑖 )
𝛼𝑖,0 = (

𝑁
𝑁−𝑁𝑖
𝑁 𝑏

𝛼𝑖,1 = ( )
𝑁𝑖

)

if 𝑦𝑖 = 0
(2)
otherwise

𝑏

(4)

where pi is the predicted probability for class i, r > 0 is the
focusing parameter of the focal loss, N is the total sample
number of the training set, Ni is the sample size of class i,
b ∈[0,1]is a tunable parameter to control the balancing
degree. The bigger the value of b, the more balance will
be reached between positive and negative examples for
each category. When b = 1, the total weights of positive
samples are equal to that of negative sample, but this may
lead to too many false positive predictions. In our
experiments, we set b to 0.5 for a compromise between
specificity and sensitivity.

Results

We evaluate our model on the challenge dataset in a 5fold cross validation. The network is implemented based
on the Keras framework, and trained on a workstation
with one CPU running at 3.5 GHz, an NVIDIA Quadro
k6000 GPU, and 64 Gb of memory. The metrics of the
model performance includes the area under the receiver
operating characteristic (AUROC), the area under the
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F2 score, G2 score and a
specialized metric for the challenge (challenge metric).
The detailed definitions of these metrics can be found in
the challenge paper [13]. The experimental results are
shown in Table 1.
From the results, we can see that the AUROC of the
models reached quite high scores, while the AUPRC
measures are much lower, indicating that the imbalance
of the dataset still have a significant impact on the results
of the classification. We note that, though the mean score
of our model on the challenge metric is higher than the

top ranked score of the challenge, these results were
obtained on the training set only and may be overoptimistic. The scores of F2, G2 and the challenge metric
are also far from ideal.

Conclusions

We took part in the 2020 PhysioNet - CinC Challenge
(in the team ECGMaster) and proposed a novel neural
network for the problem of multi-label classification of
12-lead ECG signals. The class-wise attention enable
network to learning an individual attention for each class
and avoid the conflicts between classes. We also extended
the focal loss function by add different weights to positive
and negative predictions of each class according to their
frequencies. The experimental results show that the
model achieved a high score of AUROC, but scores of
AUPRC, F2 and G2 were still unsatisfactory, where the
data imbalance is one of the main reasons and needs
further study.
