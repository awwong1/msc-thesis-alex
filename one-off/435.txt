Abstract

Manual rhythm classification in 12-lead ECGs is timeconsuming and operator-biased. We present an automatic
ECG classifier using CinC’s 2020 challenge dataset. In the
first phase of the Challenge, 9 categories were targeted
with an ensemble of 4 classifiers. In the second phase, 7
classifiers were implemented to detect 24 cardiac
electrophysiological disorders. Five classifiers identified
abnormalities in different specific regions of the heart’s
conducting system. Two classifiers were dedicated to
detect premature atrial and ventricular contractions.
The methodology is based on the creation of rhythmspecific intra and inter-patient templates. Firstly, signals
were divided into 6 regions of interests. Secondly, for each
region, intra-patient models and inter-patient rhythmspecific models were computed. The distances from each
intra-patient model to each rhythm-specific inter-patient
model as well as heart rate variability features and Global
Electric Heterogeneity features were introduced into the
classifiers.
After a 10-fold cross-validation, for the provided
training data in the first phase an accuracy of 94.4%±0.4,
and a Challenge metric of 0.644±0.031 were obtained,
whereas in the second phase an accuracy and Challenge
metric of 15.0 ± 1.0 % and 0.030 ± 0.009 were obtained.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first cause of
mortality and morbidity worldwide [1]. The standard 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential tool in
clinical practice to diagnose CVDs and to have an initial
assessment of a patient’s health condition [2]. Typically,
manual interpretation of ECGs by expert clinicians is
needed. This requires skilled personnel with high degree of
specialization and in some cases inter-operators
discrepancies are present. An automatic algorithm for
detection of cardiac abnormalities and classification of
ECG recordings could aid clinical practice, providing
clinicians with an objective tool to make an early and
accurate diagnosis of CVDs [3]. The aim of this work is to
put together machine learning techniques and
physiological know-how to build and validate such model,

using the 6 annotated datasets available for the 2020
Computing in Cardiology Challenge [4] (team name:
Germinating).

Material and Methods

2.1.

Data

Six databases were provided: China Physiological
Signal Challenge in 2018 (CPSC2018), St Petersburg
INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database, the PTB
Diagnostic
ECG
Database,
the
PTB-XL
electrocardiography Database and the Georgia 12-Lead
ECG Challenge Database. In total, 43,101 labeled 12-lead
ECGs with 111 different cardiac abnormalities labelled
following the SNOMED-CT coding system. Only 24
disorders were targeted: 1st degree AV block (IAVB),
atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL), bradycardia
(Brady), incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB),
left anterior fascicular block (LAnFB), left axis deviation
(LAD), left bundle branch block (LFBBB), low QRS
voltages
(LQRSV),
nonspecific
intraventricular
conduction disorder (NSIVCB), pacing rhythm (PR),
premature atrial complex (PAC), premature ventricular
complex (PVC), prolonged PR interval (LPR), prolonged
QT interval (LQT), Q-wave abnormal (QAb), right axis
deviation (RAD), sinus arrhythmia (SA), sinus bradycardia
(SB), normal sinus rhythm (NSR), sinus tachycardia
(STach), T-wave abnormal (TAb) and T-wave inversion
(TInv), the rest were considered “Unscored” and ignored.
For the first phase, also ST elevation (STE) and depression
(STD) were considered.

2.1.

ECG preprocessing

Two median filters were applied to obtain the baseline
of each ECG signal that was then subtracted to the original
ECG to obtain a baseline corrected signal. Power line and
high-frequency noise were removed with a finite impulse
response low-pass filter with equal ripple in the pass and
stop bands. The 3-dB point of the filter was 35 Hz. R peaks
were detected using Pan Tompkins’ algorithm [5]. To
minimize misdetections, R peaks were detected on 5 leads
with positive QRS (I, II, III, aVF, V4, V5, V6). An impulse

train signal was built based on the R peaks detected for
each lead; a Gaussian filter was applied to smooth the R
series, then signals were aligned through a crosscorrelation procedure, using V5 as reference and finally the
median signal among the 5 series was computed. On the
obtained signal, the Pan Tomkins algorithm was applied to
obtain the R peaks used on the rest of the analysis.

2.2.

Heart rate variability features

Global Electric Heterogeneity (GEH) features were
computed using the three open source toolboxes provided
by the challenge: HRV toolbox [8], ECGkit [9] and GEH
parameter extraction [10], [11] and origin point [12]. These
features included: azimuth, elevation, and magnitude of
spatial peak QRS, T and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG)
vectors, azimuth and elevation of QRS, T vectors and
Wilson’s area SVG, scalar value of the SVG, and peak and
are of the spatial QRS-T angle [10], [11].

The mean and standard deviation of the RR intervals
was computed, along with the standard deviation of the
difference of consecutive RR intervals, the percentage of
successive interval differences greater than 50 ms (pNN50)
and the root mean square of successive differences
(RMMSD).

2.3.

Intra and inter-patient models

Inter-patient models that gathered the median behaviour
of each electrohpysiological disorder in the ECG were
built for different signal segments of clinical significance.
These models were used to measure the distance of each
patient to the ECG pattern typical of each
electrophysiological disorder.
Firstly, ECG windows of interest were selected based
on the expected occurrence of different electrical events
(all values referred to the location of R peak): P-wave
(from -300 ms to -40 ms) [6], QRS-complex (-70 ms to +60
ms), PQ-ST (PT-segment with the removal of the QRSsegment, from -150 ms to +250 ms, removing the segment
from -55 ms to + 55 ms), T-wave (from +100 ms to +350
ms) [7], PR (from -288 ms to the R peak), RT (from the R
peak to +258 ms).
Secondly, intra-patient templates were computed for
each of the above-mentioned segments. For each lead, all
windows were aligned and the median waveform,
representative of the analyzed subject, was calculated. The
mean standard deviation of all windows was stored as a
feature. Thirdly, the maximum cross-correlation index was
computed between each individual region of interest and
the median intra-patient template. Fourthly, for each
rhythm, the templates of the correspondent subjects of the
training set were aligned and the median rhythm template
was obtained. Finally, the maximum cross-correlation
between each intra-patient templates and each of the interpatient models with the corresponding lags were stored as
features. In Figure 1, an example is visible for the RT
segment for NSR, RBBB and LBBB. On the left panels, all
RT segments in the recording of a subject are depicted with
the obtained intra-patient template in red. On the right, the
median intra-patient templates of all the subjects are
plotted with the resulting inter-patient template in red.

recording are overlapped in the intra-patient plots, whereas in

are in red.

2.5.

Classifier ensemble

The classification strategy adopted was to create an
ensemble of classifiers, each of them focused on a specific
region of the cardiac conductive system. A distinction was
made between sporadic conditions as PAC and PVC, and
stable conditions, all the other pathologies. As most signals
ranged from 6 s to 60 s, all arrhythmias were considered
present on the whole signal.
During phase 1, the detection of permanent conditions
was distributed into different classifiers depending on the
ECG region where the electrophysiological disorders were
manifested (Table 1). This yielded one classifier (C1)
including the cross-correlation values between interpatient and intra-patient of the P-wave and PR interval, and
another one (C2) including the QRS complex, RT segment
and T-wave information. Both classifiers included GEH
and HRV features, as well as age and sex.
Given the increase in the amount of rhythms included
in phase 2, the detection of permanent conditions was

distributed differently, according to the cardiac region of
occurrence:
• C1: Atrial tissue
• Purkinje system
o C2: Sinoatrial node
o C3: Atrioventricular (AV) node
o C4: Bundle branches
• C5: Ventricular tissue
Cross-correlation values between inter-patient and
intra-patient models were included as: P-wave and PR
segments for C1 and C3, all segments for C2, and QRS
complex, PQ-ST segment, T wave, and RT segment for C4
and C5. HRV and GEH features as well as age and sex
were included in all classifiers.
For each of the sporadic conditions (PAC and PVC) an
individual classifier was designed in both phases, which
led to a total of 4 classifiers in phase 1 and 7 in phase 2. C6
and C7 included all the HRV features and the crosscorrelation values between the intra-patient template and
the 3 beats with the shortest preceding RR interval for the
QSR and P-wave segments. Signals classified as AF or
AFL were not taken into consideration for possible PAC or
PVC.
In phase 1, C1 and C2 were support vector machines.
PAC and PVC classifiers used bagged trees. For the second
phase, in which 24 categories were included, all classifiers
used boosted trees. All classifiers were implemented in
Matlab 2020a and trained using a 10-fold cross-validation.

Results

The results obtained after the 10-fold cross-validation
of the provided datasets for phase 1 and 2 of the challenge
are gathered in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Sensitivity and
specificity values are displayed along with the number of
signals present in the dataset for each rhythm of study. In
addition, the sub-indexes C1, C2, …, C7 in the Rhythms
column indicate the classifier in which the rhythm was
included. In both phases specificity (Sp.) values were
higher than sensitivity (Se.) ones. Results in phase 1 were
superior than those in phase 2. Categories not detected by
the classifier in phase 2 have been excluded from Table 2.
Table 3 gathers the overall results obtained for the
classifier ensembles of phases 1 and 2 after a 10-fold crossvalidation on the databases provided. The Challenge

Metric (CM) used to evaluate the classifiers varied from
phase 1 to phase 2. While in phase 1 it corresponded to the
geometrical mean between Fβ measure and Gβ measure, on
phase 2 a new scoring system was used to reflect the value
of the algorithm in a clinical setting: it awarded full credit
to correct diagnoses and partial credit to misdiagnoses with
similar risks or outcomes similar to those of the actual
diagnosis.

Discussion

The aim of this work was to propose an automatic
algorithm capable of identifying different cardiovascular
diseases using 6 different databases with 43,101 labeled
recordings made available by the PhysioNet/Computing in
Cardiology Challenge 2020 [4]. Several attempts have
been already described in literature [3], [13], [14], [15].
Currently, the role of clinicians is still fundamental for the
final diagnosis, but a support role from computers could
provide a useful tool to aid them for early and correct
diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities.
The presented method intended to follow a
physiologically consistent approach. An ensemble of
classifiers was built focusing each of them on specific
cardiac regions. The electrophysiological disorders of
study were distributed into each of the classifiers
depending or their region of incidence. ECG signals were
divided into regions of interest and a comparison was
performed between intra-patient models and inter-patient
rhythm-specific models. In phase 1 the methodology
succeeded in detecting all disorders with specificity higher
than 90% and sensitivity higher than 84%, except for STE
and STD. These results are in line with those already
present in literature [15], although as different databases
are used, a comparison is not trivial. These results suggest
that intra-patient and inter-patient models manage to
capture electrophysiological disturbances of different
nature and areas of the cardiac tissue.
However, results obtained in phase 2 show that the
metrics used are not enough if a larger number of
conditions with often similar expression in the ECG are
targeted, as IRBBB and RBBB, IAVB and LPR, LAnFB
and LBBB, among others. In each classifier (C1, C2, …,
C7) at least a cardiac abnormality was detected with good
results i.e. AF in C1, STach in C2, IAVB in C3, RBBB in
C4. However, the models built and/or the metric obtained
seemed to be unable to distinguish among such an amount
of rhythms exhibiting similar morphologies.

Conclusion

We obtained promising results for the detection of a
limited number of electrophysiological abnormalities in
short signals. Further development is needed for its
application to a high number of disorders, possibly through
the implementation of convolutional neural network.
