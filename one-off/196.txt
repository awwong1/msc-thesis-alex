Abstract
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely medical tool used
in the clinical diagnosis of arrhythmia, numerous
algorithms based on deep learning have been proposed to
achieve
automatic
arrhythmia
detection.
In
PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020,
inspired by the deep residual learning and attention
mechanism, we proposed a novel neural network to
accomplish this classification task. The backbone of the
network is a carefully designed 2-D convolutional neural
network (CNN) with residual connection and attention
mechanism, and it can adapt to multi-lead ECG signals as
input. The first 10 seconds of records from all leads are
extracted and preprocessed as input for end-to-end
training, and the prediction probabilities of 27 categories
are output. The proposed algorithm was firstly verified and
adjusted via 5-fold cross-validation on officially published
datasets from 4 multiple sources. Finally, our team
(MetaHeart) achieved a challenge validation score of
0.616 and full test score of 0.370, but were not ranked due
to omissions in the submission.

Introduction

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive medical
tool to record the rhythm of the heart, the diagnosis of
abnormal ECG rhythms requires a professionally trained
cardiologist to carefully study the records, which is
extremely time-consuming. Automatic diagnosis by
computer-aided system can help improve doctors' work
efficiency, and these algorithms can even be transplanted
to wearable devices to enable real-time arrhythmia
detection in the home environment.
A large number of algorithms based on machine
learning and deep learning have been established for this

purpose in the past few decades. General machine learning
approaches for arrhythmia classification task includes
signal pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection
and final classification. The key to the machine learning
algorithm is to obtain numerous carefully designed
features based on expert knowledge, such as statistical
features [1, 2], RR-interval and morphological features [35], wavelet-based features [6, 7]. However, performances
of these models largely depend on the hand-crafted
features. In deep learning, feature engineering has almost
being replaced due to the automatic feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks, that is to say, an end-toend deep learning framework allows a machine to
automatically discover the features that are necessary and
suited to the classification task. 1-D convolutional neural
network (CNN) applied to ECG signals [8, 9], 2-D
convolutional neural network applied to time-frequency
spectrogram [10, 11], combination of CNN and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network [12, 13], and
numerous other end-to-end networks have been proposed
and verified to be effective in the field of arrhythmia
detection.
The goal of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge 2020 is to identify 27 types of arrhythmia from
12-lead ECG recordings, and performance of all submitted
models will be evaluated by a defined evaluation score
called challenge metric. We proposed a novel 2-D
convolutional neural network with residual connection and
attention mechanism to achieve the target in this study. The
first 10 seconds of records from all leads are extracted as
input for end-to-end training, and the prediction
probabilities of 27 categories are the output of the model.
Performance of the proposed model was cross-validated on
officially published datasets from 4 multiple sources and
ultimately evaluated on hidden test set.

Datasets and preprocessing

block, and the size will become 3 from the 9th block on. For
the first 6 blocks, the filter size in the direction of “lead” is
set to 1, which can ensure that the information across lead
is not exchanged at lower layers but just share the same
filter, and the filter size will be adjust to 3 at higher blocks
in the direction of “lead”, which makes each individual
convolution filter not only perceives the information of the
current lead, but also perceives cross-lead information,
thus making cross-lead information fusion possible.
Stride: It controls the step of two adjacent convolution
operations, the first several blocks are allocated the
relatively lager stride as 2 to significantly reduce the
dimension of feature map passed to the next block, and
blocks use a stride of 1 from the 6th block on.
Batch normalization and spatial dropout: Batch
normalization (BN) [15] has been demonstrated to speed
up the convergence of network and alleviate the risk of
over-fitting. Spatial dropout [16] is a widely used strategy
to prevent over-fitting, which drop the feature maps
randomly with a preset rate, and is more suitable for
convolutional layers than standard dropout strategy [17].
Attention module: We added an attention module called
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [18] to blocks. It is a
channel-wise attention mechanism, each feature map will
be calculated with a channel-wise weight matrix, and then
the dot product of this matrix and the original map
constitutes the reweighted feature map, and this weight
matrix reflects the importance of individual feature map.
These weights will be finally automatically learned by the
network in the process of gradient back-propagation.
Activation: Relu is adopted to all layers except for the
output layer, and the output layer use sigmoid due to the
fact that ECG signal in the real-world can contain more
than one type of arrhythmia, so it’s actually a multi-label
classification problem. sigmoid can independently map the
output to a probability value in the range of 0 to 1.
Global average pooling layer: A global average pooling

The publicly available datasets consist of a total of
43,101 subjects from 4 different sources. 12-lead ECG
signals and corresponding labels of all individuals in
dataset were recorded in separate files, only 27 categories
will be considered in the final evaluation score [14]. The
sampling rate of the data set varies from 257 to 1000 Hz,
the original ECG signals are firstly down-sampled to 100
Hz to reduce memory consumption and speed up model
training. In addition, a band pass filter with a cut-off
frequency of 0.05 to 20 Hz is designed to eliminate
baseline drift and high frequency noise. The first 10
seconds of records are maintained due to the median length
of all records is 10 seconds, and then data will be truncated
or expanded with 0 to a consistent length. Z-score
normalization is applied to normalize signals in all leads.

Model architecture

Three specially designed blocks are stacked to form the
backbone of the proposed model, as shown in Figure 1. 2D convolutional network is mainly applied to the field of
image recognition, so Huang et al. [10] and Salem et al.
[11] transformed ECG signals to time-frequency images at
first in their frameworks. Different from their approaches,
however, multi-lead ECG signals can also be regarded as
2-D input with two dimensions, we call them “lead” and
“sample”, and we can enable the network perceive
information from the single lead as well as cross-lead by
controlling the shape of the 2-D convolutional filter size.
Filter: A large convolution filter (or kernel) size in the
dimension of “sample” is adopted to the first block to
enhance the perception field, and decay from the second

layer and the output layer.
Loss function: The 27 categories considered in
evaluation score will be encoded in binary form as
label = [l1 ,l2 ,...,l27 ] , and for each record, if their category
exists in 27 categories, set the corresponding binary bit to
1. A weighted binary cross-entropy loss is designed as the
optimization target, its definition is as follows.
1 m
CE = -  wi * (yi log(hi )+(1 - yi )log(1 - hi )) (1)
m i=1
Where yi and hi are the true label and prediction score
for category i , separately, and the total average is
considered as the final loss. Weights are assigned to each
class to alleviate the problem of class imbalance, which is
defined as follows.

(2)
wi = log 2 (
)
ni N +e
Where ni is the frequency of category i ,

N is the total

number of samples, and  is set to 0.01 to prevent division
by 0.
The above model was implemented using Keras with
Tensorflow backend.

Model training

Data are randomly divided in a ratio of 8:2 for training
and testing, and the training set is further divided in a ratio
of 9:1 as training and validation dataset. Adam with an
initial learning rate of 0.001 is applied for optimization.
Hyper parameters of the network (dropout rate, number of
blocks, etc.) are adjusted empirically according to the
performance on validation dataset to achieve optimal
performance. Early-stopping and reduce learning rate with
a ratio of 0.5 during training are also adopted to alleviate
over-fitting.

Results and discussion

We verified and adjusted our algorithm on officially
published datasets from 4 multiple sources (including
43,101 subjects) by 5-fold cross-validation, the average
evaluation score (challenge metric) on publicly available
dataset was 0.621, and the score on hidden test set our team
(MetaHeart) obtained is shown in Table 1.

An ablation study was adapted to analyze the effect of 3
strategies on model performance elevation: (a) Remove the
attention layer; (b) Replace the spatial dropout by standard
dropout; (c) Replace GAP by fully connected (FC) layer.
The cross-validated averaged evaluation score on publicly
available datasets is shown in Table 2.
Dropout is a strategy we used to alleviate over-fitting
and improve generalization performance, the performance
of both standard dropout and spatial dropout have been
compared in this study, the results show that the
performance of using standard dropout is worse than using
spatial dropout. It is mainly because the model is easy to
over-fit to training set according to our experiment. In fact,
dropout works by preventing activations from becoming
strongly correlated in network, it assumes independence
between the activations. However, the activations in a
same feature map are also strongly correlated in CNN, so
standard dropout may not work effectively [16]. Spatial
dropout between convolutional layers drops the entire
feature maps rather than individual activations to alleviate
this problem, so it achieved better performance.
The GAP layer between the last convolutional layer and
the output layer also helps to improve the performance of
the model. The FC layer will increase the amount of model
parameters, and the loss in validation set in our experiment
indicates that the model is easier to over-fit. In fact, the
training data set is relatively smaller compared to other
fields such as images recognition, and our network is
consist of a larger number of filters and deep layers, which
makes the capacity of the network pretty large. The use of
the GAP layer after the last convolutional layer is more
native to the convolution structure by enforcing
correspondences between feature maps and categories [19],
and it greatly reduces the amount of model parameters and
reduces the risk of over-fitting.
It can be also observed that using an SE attention layer
provides improvement in performance. Generally
explanation is that attention layer can help the network to
know where to emphasize or suppress by automatically
learning the information flow from the above layer.

Limitations of this study includes that we only used
ECG signals with a length of 10 seconds, which may
ignore information especially some intermittent abnormal
rhythms, a network that can accommodate variable length

input will be designed in the future. In addition, we only
used a single model to predict the output, which can be
replaced by an ensemble model in the future to further
improve performance.

Conclusion

Inspired by the deep residual learning and attention
mechanism, we proposed a novel 2-D convolutional neural
network to identify 27 types of arrhythmia from 12-lead
ECG recordings in an end-to-end training manner. An
ablation study was performed to analyze the effect of 3
strategies on performance elevation, it was found that
spatial dropout instead of standard dropout, GAP instead
of FC layer after the convolutional layer and the
introduction of the attention mechanism had a positive
effect on model performance improvement. The average
challenge metric of 5-fold cross-validation on publicly
available datasets was 0.621, and we ultimately achieved a
challenge validation score of 0.616 and full test score of
0.370. In future work, we will design a network that can
accommodate variable length input and use an ensemble
framework to fuse multiple models to further enhance the
model performance.
