Abstract

Heart arrhythmia classification algorithms are an
important tool for continuous monitoring of patients at
risk. By analyzing 12 ECG-lead signals, these algorithms
can help us to diagnose different cardiac diseases.
Thus, our team, CardioLux proposes a novel approach
to denoise ECG signals and classify the nine cardiac
arrhythmias using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
trained with more than 6700 ECG recordings as defined in
the Physionet Challenge 2020.
First, a noise removal process is initially applied with
Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters. Secondly, we extracted
300 features, clustered in time, frequency, and timefrequency groups, including linear and non-linear
characteristics. Thirdly, 27 features were carefully
selected to train our model using our feature-selection
procedure. Finally, we implemented CNN to reduce noiseaware signals and bias during our training model.
The proposed methodology developed so far was tested
with 10-fold cross-validation on the training set and
yielded a challenge score of 0.22. Overall, the feature
extraction and selection stage can help improve the
performance of the heart arrhythmia training model by
selecting the best characteristics. Our model keeps a high
level of interpretability, demonstrating a high range of
possibilities that can be configured using CNN.

ECG data analysis can help to detect different arrhythmias.
Heart arrhythmia classification algorithms are an essential
tool for continuous monitoring and diagnosis of patients at
risk to prevent future cardiac diseases. Therefore, early
detection is necessary for its correct management.
These algorithms can help us to assess and diagnose
cardiac diseases by analyzing 12 ECG-lead signals. Early
detection is essential for correct management and
treatment. Motion artifacts such as those of different
intensity of movements can contaminate the signals,
leading to a wrong diagnosis [3].
Thus, our team called CardioLux proposes a novel
approach to denoise ECG signals and classify the nine
cardiac arrhythmias defined in the Physionet Challenge
2020 [4]. First, a noise removal process was initially
applied to the raw dataset using the Symlet wavelets family
and Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters. Secondly, we
extracted 300 features, clustered in time, frequency, and
statistical measurement groups, including linear and nonlinear characteristics, to obtain hidden information that
models specific heart arrhythmia. Thirdly, 27 features were
carefully selected to train our model using our featureselection procedure. Finally, we implemented a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset
provided contained 6877 ECG recordings used for the
creation of training models.

Introduction

ECG is a standard non-invasive measurement that can
reflect the physiology activities of the hearth [1]. Also, it
is an indispensable tool for the diagnosis and prompt
initiation of therapy in patients with heart diseases [2].

Methodology

The methodology proposed is shown in Figure 1. This
methodology is composed of data pre-processing, filtering,
features extraction and selection and training of neural
network models to classify data into the nine categories
defined.

Pre-processing

In this stage, the data is prepared before the feature
extraction process. Firstly, data analysis was performed to
verify the quantity and quality of the dataset. Fields such
as “sex” were changed from characters to numbers, and the
ones with missing values were filled using the mean value
of the field. Secondly, a spectral analysis was performed
using wavelet decomposition with Daubechies family
wavelets and Symlet family wavelets, which determined
that there was high and low-noise frequency on the bands:
[5 - 60] hz, [75-90] hz, [160-170] hz frequencies of the
signal.
It should be highlighted that the wavelet analysis also
involved a thresholding method, which helped us
determine the high and low-frequency components of the
noise in the frequency domain, showing that the ECG
signal concentrates its information widely on the 1-10 Hz
frequency band. However, we could even consider that the
real concentration of the information is between 1-4 Hz (a
very narrow band). This could be a problem, since the
information signal is being overlapped with the noise
frequency component inside this interval, making difficult
the noise extraction. The main consequence over the signal
of these so mentioned artefacts is the baseline drift,
introduced principally because of the friction of the
electrodes with the skin, the movement created by the
patient normal activities and environmental variables, such
as the temperature, which might change the normal
electrical activity of the electrode's materials. The
movement of the extremities causes this low-frequency
noise. Another effect of these artefacts is the highfrequency noise, that can be witnessed as very slight and
frequent peaks, sometimes imperceptible, which follow the
curve of the signal.

specific arrhythmias. Firstly, wavelets functions were used
for denoising the signal, filtering out high frequency
components of noise. On the best results, there is a
coincidence over the wavelet decomposition method with
Mallat's algorithm, using Symlet family in the majority of
the cases. In two cases were obtained the best results using
Daubechies family wavelets, which showed good overall
results in the studies. However, linear filters yielded a
better response, therefore, we decided to take this approach
for denoising our signal more accurately.
The Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter is a type of digital
filtering technique based on convolution, a process that fits
successive segments of adjacent data with an adjustable
degree polynomial regression, using the linear least
squares criteria for fitting points [5].
The main advantage of this kind of filter is the
preservation of the main characteristics of the original
distribution of the signal, such as local maxima and
minima. For this reason, and in our case, it can accurately
reduce the level of noise without biasing the morphology
of the ECG signal. It also discriminates high-frequency
noise since it keeps low-frequency features such as
baseline drift, but removes some others like highfrequency peaks, smoothing the signal. Thus, in order to
reduce the baseline drift noise, which enables us to focus
on the analysis of the fluctuations in the data about the
trend, we created a detrend method for its exclusion, since
it’s a type of noise that could bias the backpropagation
process during the model training: This method finds the
trend of the original signal, using the number of desired
breakpoints over the length of , making a similar process
as method A. Then it links them using linear functions and
returns a signal containing an estimate of the baseline drift
over the entire length of the signal.

Filtering

This stage was focused on finding the best denoiser to
obtain better results over accuracy in the detection of 9

Feature Extraction

The result of this process found 300 features that were
categorized into the following:
• Time features. Included the QRS intervals, RR
intervals, energy, self-correlation, and centroid.

Statistical measurements. Kurtosis and skewness
were used to represent the variations to the normal
distribution of the signals. Other measures were
standard deviation, mean, median, and variance.
Frequency features. Included the Power Spectral
Density (PSD) and the spectral centroid. PSD
describes the variation of power into different
frequencies. If 𝑋(𝑓) is Fourier Transform of 𝑥(𝑡)
signal, then [6]:
𝑆𝑥𝑥 (𝑓) = ℱ {𝑅𝑥𝑥 (𝜏)}

Where 𝑅𝑥𝑥 is autocorrelation function of x(t).
The spectral centroid [7] provides the gravity
center for the spectrum by considering the
spectrum as a probability distribution. The
spectral centroid is:
𝐶𝑒 =

∑ 𝑓𝑘 𝑠𝑘
∑ 𝑠𝑘

Where 𝑓𝑘 is the frequency in k and 𝑠𝑘 is the
spectral value in k.
Non-linear features, such as Shannon entropy and
Spectral Entropy (SE) are considered. Firstly, the
Shannon entropy is based on the information
theory and used to evaluate the distribution
complexity of heartbeat signal samples [8].
While, and Spectral Entropy is a generalization of
information entropy and has been proposed to
measure the distribution of frequencies [9]. If
𝑥(𝑖) is a signal and 𝑋(𝑚) is the Fourier
Transform of 𝑥(𝑖), the probability distribution is:
𝑃 (𝑚 ) =

𝑆 (𝑚 )
∑𝑖 𝑆(𝑖 )

Neural Networks

Initially, the combination between a Recurrent Neural
Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent
Neural Networks was proposed to classify the different
arrhythmias classes. However, in light of the results
obtained, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN)
was prioritized because they showed better performance.
Our CNN is composed of a one-dimensional
convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), which uses four
output filters, a kernel size of four for the convolutional
window, one size-stride for the window shifting, input
shape determined by the 27-sequence data and a ReLU
activation function is adopted for the activation.
The use of various denoising techniques was executed
over different neural network architectures, where the
focus falls in tachycardias and bradycardias. For example,
we consider using Daubechies family with thresholding
method which in our case removes the high-frequency
noise components by thresholding only the wavelet
coefficient of the detail sub-bands, however, this approach
is taken as future work to investigate in detail its possible
results after applying our classification method. The new
research path could be, either by using more levels of
decomposition, or by also discriminating between the
approximation levels, or by using wavelet packages
instead of the decomposition that is done only towards the
approximation component.

We performed K-fold cross-validation with K=10 in the
training data to obtain the challenge score. For this process,
we devised the following process.
The challenge provides all the patient data in separate
files. One file contains all 12-lead ECG records per patient.
Also, driver, training, and scoring functions are defined to
provide a single challenge score. The driver function has
input and output folders with M files; and the scoring
function takes the M outputs and calculates accuracy,
precision, F-measure and the Challenge Score.
Our algorithm creates K-folders with an equal number
of files from the patients data, distributed randomly. Each
i fold from the K folders is chosen as a test subset and the
remaining K-1 folders as training subsets. Output
predictions are saved per i fold, and therefore used into the
scoring function to calculate the challenge score. K scores
are obtained. Finally, the average challenge score is
obtained from the K-fold scores.

Discussions and conclusions

In this paper, we proposed a methodology that allows
identifying the nine arrhythmia classes from 12-lead ECG
signals. The filtering process encompasses a wide variety
of denoising techniques with different families of wavelets
and smoothing filters. We aimed at performing a
comparative analysis that would allow us to find a
denoiser-classifier
combination
which
produces
satisfactory results and an improvement over accuracy in
the detection of 9 specific arrhythmias. Results throw a
coincidence over the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter and
a baseline detrended filter as the best method for cleaning
the signal. Then, we focused on implementing a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in order to classify
the nine arrhythmias, which was trained using more than
6800 ECG recordings, reaching a challenge score of 0.22
during the K-Fold cross-validation on the training data.
Other neural networks were developed as well, including
RNN, and LSTM and hybrid architectures that involved a
mixture of both and with CNN.
Better denoising methods can be applied to highlight
specific relevant sections over the ECG morphology,
which could be helpful to zoom in certain arrhythmia
features. In order to obtain better results, we also tested the
moving average filter over the entire training set. However,
since it is a regular low-pass filter due to its slow roll-off
and poor stopband attenuation, we also implemented a
Butterworth filter to suppress the high frequencies over the
interval [160-170] HZ. Similarly, different denoising
techniques with family wavelets with higher
decomposition levels can be applied to obtain similar or
better results, as obtained by Savitzky-Golay Smoothing
filter.
Another esencial fact to consider is that the sole use of
ECG signals can perform well into a classification
problem, but the results are reinforced when other types of
complementary signals such as additional signals are used,
such as PPG or ABP.
Future work involves the enhancement of our CNN
architecture by incorporating a windowing segmentation
method with the Hanning window to perform the feature
extraction process using R peaks from the signal. Using
this approach might yield better for the classification of
different types of arrhythmia. However, due to lack of
computational resources and lack of time, these results
could not be presented for the challenge testing score, but
optimistic results could be expected since more featurewise information could incrementally feed our model.
