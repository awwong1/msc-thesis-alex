Abstract

Throughout the years, there have been many attempts
to develop an accurate cardiac arrhythmias identification
algorithm. However, despite achieving acceptable results,
they have been only applied on either small or homogeneous data-sets. A study was developed herein to identify cardiac arrhythmias from varied-length 12-lead ECG
signals obtained from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 and acquired from a wide set
of sources. Our team, Care4MyHeart, developed an approach that starts by analyzing the labels of the database.
Then, applying various signal processing techniques to denoise the 12-lead signals. After that a beat-by-beat segmentation procedure was followed to identify the most significant beats in exhibiting the arrhythmia within the signals. A CNN+BiLSTM model was then trained and evaluated on the training set using 10-fold cross-validation
scheme as well as on hidden validation and testing sets.
Our approach achieved a challenge validation score of
0.379 and full test score of 0.146 on the hidden validation and testing sets, respectively. Our team was ranked
the 26th out of 41 entries in this year’s Challenge.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is considered the most
common cause of death with an overall 31% of total deaths
worldwide. The majority of CVD deaths are due to cardiac
arrhythmias [1]. Currently, electrocardiography (ECG) has
been widely used by clinicians as an essential tool to represent the electrical activity of the heart. Despite being
able of identifying and localizing arrhythmias successfully
from an ECG signal, the process requires high efforts due
to the interference and noise contaminated within the signals [2]. In addition, it is considered time-consuming for
clinicians to diagnose a wide range of patients’ on case by
case basis.
In this work, we propose a deep learning approach using
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Bi-directional
long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to automatically iden-

tify cardiac arrhythmias from 12-lead ECG obtained from
the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020
[3]. The novelty of the work presented herein lies in detecting the most significant beats within an ECG signal and extracting their corresponding spatial and temporal features
using a CNN+BiLSTM network.

Material and methods

2.1.

Database preparation

Initially, the database was fixed in terms of patients’ arrhythmia types to include only the challenge-scored patients labels. The database comes originally with a total of 111 arrhythmia types, out of which only 27 were
included for the scoring of the challenge. From these
27 types, 6 arrhythmia types were merged to have the
same label; namely complete right bundle branch block
and right bundle branch block, premature atrial contraction and supraventricular premature beats, and premature
ventricular contractions and ventricular premature beats.
The edited data-set included a total of 24 arrhythmia
types/labels after the fixing procedure.
Furthermore, several patients had multiple labels due
to having multiple arrhythmia types. To ensure the inclusion of all types, each patient data was duplicated for
each arrhythmia type such that multiple signals might be
the identical while representing different types of arrhythmia. It worth noting that due to the huge un-balance in
the database in favor of the sinus rhythm (normal) labeled
recordings (34.53%), it was randomly reduced to less than
25% of its total amount (20846) after the duplication.

2.2.

Pre-processing

The pre-processing steps were performed to reduce the
noise contaminated within ECG signals. Noise sources
may be power-line interference, movement artifact, and
base-line wander. It is important to have less noisy signals prior to any feature extraction methodology, while at
the same time, maintain the original morphological information of each signal. To achieve this, the following sub-

less than 1 dB of passband ripple, and more than 2.5 dB
of stopband attenuation. The filter was allowed to run in
the forward and inverse directions to reduce the effects of
phase-shifting.

2.2.3. Wavelet smoothing
Wavelet smoothing has been widely used in nonstationary signal analysis to decompose any signal into a
group of mother wavelets. In this work, it was performed
to make the signals less variable across each time step.
Furthermore, it was followed to provide a smoother morphological information of each beat within the 10 seconds
segment. Noise contaminated within signals maybe be due
to frequent movements or muscular motion artifacts. To
reduce this effect, the smoothing was based on the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). In addition, a soft version of the MODWT smoother was used
of level 4 with a Daubechies 5 (db5) mother wavelet.

sections briefly describe the methods followed. By the end
of the pre-processing stage, all signals were z-score normalized to ensure a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
for each signal.

2.2.1. Signals re-sampling
The database comes with signals sampled at 1000 Hz,
500 Hz, and 257 Hz due to the collection of different 12lead ECG sources. Therefore, all signals were re-sampled
to have a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Then, only the first 10
seconds segment from each lead signal was taken to reduce
the complexity of the algorithm. If a signal was recorded
for less than 10 seconds, it was padded with zeros.

2.2.2. Power-line filtering
Power-line interference is a common noise source in any
ECG signal. It is characterized by having a sinusoidal pattern of a high frequency (50 Hz to 60 Hz). Such narrowband noise ruins the extraction of useful information from
any ECG signal. Therefore, a butterworth low-pass filter
was used with passband of 50 Hz, stopband of 60 Hz,

Baseline wander is defined as a low frequency artifact
that corrupts any ECG signal and occurs due to strong
movements, breathing, or a displacement of electrodes
during the recording. It is essential to remove such effects
without affecting the overall shape of beats. To achieve
this, a local polynomial regression smoother (LOESS) was
used for its fast and simple ability of reducing wandering
effects. Each ECG signal was fitted with a weighted leastsquares function of a 0.2 scaling factor.

2.3.

Beat-wise analysis

Instead of using the whole ECG leads’ signal separately
to extract features, a step was required to detect the most
significant beats representing the arrhythmia morphological details. To segment each ECG signal into multiple
beats, the famous Pan-Tompkins algorithm [4] was followed. The algorithm detects the location of R-peaks using several adaptive filters and thresholds. To obtain the
complete QRS-complex of a single beat, 30 samples were
taken before and after the location of the R-peak. The
complete beat is a combination of P, QRS-complex, and
T waves, therefore, the detection of the whole beat segment was done by applying windows in the forward and
backward direction from the QRS-complex. The forward
window was of a length of 2/3 of the peak-to-peak (RR) interval between the current R-peak and the next one in the
signal. On the other hand, the backward window was of
a length of 1/3 of the RR interval between the current Rpeak and the previous one in the signal. The complete beat
segment included a total of 250 samples. It worth noting
that the first and last beats in each signal were discarded, as

many signals were corrupted at the beginning and ending
of the signals. In addition, they had less samples number
compared to other beats due to not having an R-peak before or after.
To identify which beat is the most significant, a correlation was applied between each beat and the beat that
follows. The beat with the lowest correlation value was
selected as the beat that is highly representing the arrhythmia type within the signal. Then, the selected beat was
duplicated three times (750 samples per signal) to increase
the length of the segment. Due to the huge imbalance in
the database, each arrhythmia type was balanced by selecting the most significant beats number that balances the
number of samples. For example, if an arrhythmia type
had only 1000 recordings compared to the highest number
of recordings per class, i.e. 2000, two lowest correlation
beats were selected per recording instead of one. Both
beats were labeled with the same arrhythmia type to increase the number of samples in the database.

Neural network architecture

The architecture of the network followed in this work
was based on a combination of 1D convolutional neural
networks (CNNS) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
units. The CNN allows for extracting features related to
the morphology as well as the spatial structure of beats. In
addition, the LSTM units capture temporal features from
the beats in time-domain. The combination of both networks usually allows for a better performance.
Initially, an input layer was added to allow for multichannel 1D inputs to the network. Then, the CNN was
designed to include a total of 12 layers; namely 3 1D convolutional, 3 batch normalization (BN), 3 rectified linear
unit (ReLU), 2 dropout, and 1 max pooling layers. The
convolutional layer had 32, 64, and 96 filters with kernel
sizes of 21, 11, 3, respectively. Each convolutional layer
was followed by a BN, ReLu, and 30% dropout layers. Finally, the CNN ends with a maxpooling layer followed by a
BN and ReLu to reduce the dimensionality of the network.
On the other hand, the LSTM network was selected to
include a total of 200 hidden-units. Each unit is connected
by four gates; namely the input, output, forget, and cell
gates. The structure of the network was determined to process the data in the forward and backward direction as a
Bi-directional LSTM functionality.

2.4.1. Training configuration
The training was allowed to run for 10 epochs with a
mini-batch size of 1024 to include as much samples as
possible. In addition, the optimization was based on the
adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) solver with learning
rate of 0.001 and L2 -regularization value of 0.0005.

Performance evaluation

The performance of the algorithm was evaluated on both
the training and testing data-sets. For the training set, a
k-fold cross-validation scheme of 10 folds was followed.
On the other hand, the testing set was completely hidden
and evaluated by the challenge organizers. The evaluation metrics are described briefly in the challenge [3] and
includes the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the recall-precision
curve (AUPRC), accuracy, macro F-measure, F-beta, Gbeta, and the final challenge metric. Furthermore, a rank
was given to each team by the end of the official phase
based on the final challenge metric scoring.

ther being stable at the time of recording or due to a damaged recorded ECG. Future works will focus on the evaluation of the database in a signal-by-signal basis to ensure
signals with an arrhythmia type truly exhibit this abnormality within the recording. In addition, developing an
approach to analyze the recordings with only leads of high
impact instead of the whole 12-lead signals.

The results of the approach followed in extracting most
significant beats is illustrated in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the
performance of the k-fold cross-validation applied on the
training set is provided in Table 1. The average challenge
score across the 10 folds was 0.303 with an AUROC average of 0.838. On the other hand, the algorithm was
evaluated on the hidden validation set and the final testing
set and reached a challenge score of 0.379 and 0.146, respectively. Breaking up the final testing set, our algorithm
achieved scores of 0.611, 0.342, and -0.027 on testing set

Discussion and conclusions

The performance of the algorithm was not relatively
high and this could be due to different reasons. Many signals did not exhibit the arrhythmia within its beats during
the first 10 seconds of the recording. In addition, the imbalance in the data-set should be carefully dealt with to
improve the performance. Furthermore, many patients did
not show the arrhythmia within their recording due to ei-
