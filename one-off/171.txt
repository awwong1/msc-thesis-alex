Introduction

This paper describes a fully automated algorithm for
detection of cardiac pathologies. This algorithm was
created within PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2020. Detailed
information about this competition including a
description of the metrics for algorithm evaluation is in
[1].
This algorithm is able to detect rhythm pathologies atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFL), pacing rhythm
(PR), sinus arrhythmia (SA), sinus tachycardia (STach)
and sinus bradycardia (SB); conduction disturbances - 1st
degree AV block (IAVB), prolonged PR interval (LPR),
complete and incomplete right bundle branch block

(RBBB and IRBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB),
left anterior fascicular block (LAnFB) and nonspecific
intraventricular
conduction
disorder
(NSIVCB);
premature atrial and ventricular contraction (PAC and
PVC); left and right axis deviation (LAD and RAD); low
QRS (LQRSV) and T wave abnormal (TAb).
The success of the developed algorithms was
determined on publicly available PhysioNet/CinC
Challenge 2020 databases and on a hidden test set
included in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2020 [1]. This
database contains 6 subdatabases - China Physiological
Signal Challenge 2018 database (CPSC) [2], Southeast
University in China database (CPSC 2), St Petersburg
INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database [3], PTB
Diagnostic ECG Database [3, 4], PTB-XL database [3, 5,
6] and Georgia database (Georgia). Bradycardia (Brady),
prolonged QT interval (LQT), Q wave abnormal (QAb)
and T wave inversion (TInv) that were scored in the
challenge are not detected by our algorithm.
The name of our team in the challenge was HITTING.

Methods

The block diagram of the proposed algorithm is shown
in the Figure 1. The first step of the algorithm is QRS
detection. Detection of the P-wave and the T-wave and
the extraction of features describing the QRS morphology
are performed on the averaged PQRST segment. We
average only those segments that have a dominant QRS
morphology in the record. Segments of another QRS
morphology are excluded because they are either
pathological complexes or artifacts. Features for
classification are extracted from the averaged QRS and
from intervals between detected points (P, QRS and T
and their onsets and offsets). Appropriate features and
rules were set using classification trees.

transform and thresholding. Next, the tangent was
simulated at the point of the steepest slope of the curve
after the peak T. The offset of the T wave was determined
at the point where this tangent intersects the zero isoline.
T wave onsets were not detected because this point is not
significant for any pathology.

QRS detection

To obtain reliable QRS positions, the detection was
performed using combination of 3 detectors – based on
phasor transform, continuous wavelet transform, and Stransform. This detector is described in detail in [7].

The first step of the clustering is the alignment of QRS
complexes. The cross-correlation between the individual
QRS complexes is then calculated. The complexes are
thus divided into clusters according to morphology. For
detection of most pathologies, only the cluster containing
QRS complexes of the most common morphology is
preserved. The PQRST segments containing the QRS of
the most frequent morphology are finally averaged.

2.3.
QRS, P waves and T waves onsets and
offsets detection
Detection of QRS, P waves and T waves onsets and
offsets was performed using the averaged PQRST
segment. For QRS onset and offset detection we used an
algorithm based on wavelet transform and thresholding,
specifically we used the bior 1.5 wavelet. The detector of
QRS onsets and offsets was previously used in the
challenge with name ISCE 2018 LBBB Initiative, where
it was evaluated as the most accurate of all competing
algorithms. This algorithm is described in [8]. We used an
algorithm based on phasor transform to detect P waves
including P waves boundaries. This algorithm is
described in [9]. T waves were detected using wavelet

Features extraction and classification

We extracted features potentially suitable for detection
of any pathology. The most suitable features and
thresholds were determined for some pathologies based
on standard medical definitions of those pathologies
(STach, SB, IAVB, LPR, LBBB, PR, NSIVCB, LQRSV
and SNR). For other pathologies the most suitable
features and thresholds were selected using classification
trees (AF, AFL, SA, RBBB, IRBBB, LAnFB, LAD,
RAD, PAC, PVC, and Tab).
Pathologies detected according to medical definitions
were detected as follows:
- IAVB and LPR are the same pathology, so we merged
them. IAVB and LPR were detected when
PQ interval is longer than or equal to 205 ms. It is
detected only when AF is not detected in the same
record.
- STach was detected when heart rate is higher than
100 bpm. STach is detected only when AF is not
detected in the same record.
- SB: was detected when heart rate is lower than 60 bpm.
SB is detected only when AF is not detected in the
same record.
- LBBB was detected according to the modified Strauss
criteria. The criteria for LBBB include the presence of
QS- or rS- configurations of QRS in V1 and V2, the
presence of mid-QRS notching or slurring in at least
two of leads V1, V2, V5, V6, I and aVL, and finally a
QRS duration longer than 130 ms for women or
longer than 140 ms for men. The detection algorithm
is described in detail in [8].
- NSIVCB was detected when the QRS duration was
longer than 120 ms and at the same time this record
was not classified as LBBB or RBBB.
- PR was detected when the median of slope
curtosis > 162 or sum of samples (where the sum of
slope values > 140) > 2 or (number of possible spikes
> 5 and median kurtosis of the signal with enhanced
spikes > 250); exclusion of signals with artifact
spikes; exclusion of signals where the sum of beats
where the distance between spike and QRS is
0-300 ms is lower than half number of detected
spikes.
- LQRSV was detected when maximum minus minimum
of QRS amplitude (mean of this difference in all
leads) is lower than 0.5 mV and at the same time
maximum QRS amplitude in lead III is lower than
0.25 mV.

- SNR was determined when no other pathology was
detected. Although the sinus rhythm can be present at
the same time with other pathologies, in most
databases this class is separated from the others.
Other pathologies are detected using more complex
classification trees. Only CPSC, PTB-XL and Georgia
database were used to train the classification tree. Fivefold cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting.
The most useful features for each pathology are
described below. The features describing the QRS
morphology were derived from the averaged QRS.
- AF: 1. ECG filtration with bandpass filter 20-40 Hz and
then cross-correlation of sections 300 ms before the
QRS onset; 2. Shannon entropy of RR intervals and
NN intervals.
- AFL: 1. zero crossing of the 6th frequency band of
stationary WT; 2. heart rate; 3. standard error of RR
interval. AFL is detected only when AF is not
detected in the same record.
- SA was detected using features obtained from the
analysis of NN intervals. The NN interval indicates
the distance between adjacent QRS complexes
originating from the sinus node. The best features of
our proposed features are defined by the following
equations:
max(NN)-min(NN);
min(NN)/median(NN);
max(NN) / median(NN).
Another significant feature is heart rate. SA is
detected only when AF, PR and AFL are not detected
in the same record.
- (C)RBBB: 1. R duration in V1; 2. S duration in I, V1
and V6; 3. ID Time in II, III and V1; 4. PQ interval.
ID Time is the time from QRS onset to the peak of the
R.
- IRBBB: 1. T amplitude in V2-V6; 2. R duration in V1;
3. ID Time in V1.
- LAnFB: 1. maximum amplitude of QRS in II, III and
aVF; 2. morphology of rS in II and aVF.
- LAD: 1. R duration in I and V6; 2. S duration in I; 3.
maximum amplitude of QRS in I, II, aVF and V4.
- RAD: 1. maximum amplitude of QRS in I, III, V6; 2.
S duration in V5.
- PAC, SVPB: The number of NN intervals shorter than
0.9 * median(NN) and at the same time the following
NN interval is longer than 1.1 * median(NN)
- PVC, VPB: 1. minimum, maximum, variance, median
and mean of correlation between aligned current QRS
and pattern (median) QRS, 2. maximum number of
leads in which the current QRS correlation
coefficients are lower than 0.83, 3. minimum RRPVC
interval/median(RR).
- TAb: 1. T amplitude in aVR, V3-V6; 2. area under T in
V3 and V6.

* IAVB and LPR were merged into one group for PTBXL
The success of the detection of individual pathologies
from the four largest available databases can be seen in
Table 1. These results were obtained on public parts of
the databases (training score). Column validation means
score for challenge hidden validation dataset, the

algorithm could be tested ten times on this data.
Some databases contain only a small number of some
pathologies and therefore the success rates are unreliable.
This is because the correct or incorrect classification of a
few records will cause large changes in success. The
values are highlighted in gray in Table 1 if the number of
signals with the particular pathology in the database is
less than 50. The number of individual pathologies in the
validation set is unknown.
The final challenge validation score was 0.435, and
full test score was 0.354, placing us 11 out of 41 in the
official ranking.

Discussion

Detection of AF, STach, IAVB + LPR, RBBB, LBBB
and LAD achieves consistently good success. PR
pathology is represented mainly in the PTB-XL database,
where the success rate is high. There are only three
signals with PR in the CPSC 2 database, but none is
detected correctly.
Classification success of SB is fluctuating. It is
because some databases use a threshold of 60 bpm, while
others use 50 bpm. The classification success of LAnFB
and RAD is also fluctuating. This is probably due to the
different definition of these pathologies in different
databases.
Detection of AFL, NSIVCB, TAb and LQRSV has
very little success. This is due to the vague definition of
these pathologies and therefore poor-quality features. The
vague definition of pathologies is difficult to solve with
the procedure we use. The pathologies LQT, QAb, Brady,
and TInv were excluded from the final version of the
software due to the low success of the classification.
The advantage of our algorithm is that the algorithm is
easy to interpret, it is obvious according to which features
the signal is classified and what thresholds are used.

Conclusion

We introduced an algorithm for detection of 19 cardiac
pathologies. The success of the proposed algorithm was
determined on publicly available PhysionNet/CinC
Challenge 2020 databases and on the hidden test set
within the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2020 [1]. Our
approach achieved a challenge validation score of 0.435,
and full test score of 0.354, placing us 11 out of 41 in the
official ranking, although 4 pathologies were not detected
by our algorithm.
