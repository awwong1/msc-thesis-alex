Abstract
The objective of the study is to explore the potentiality
of combining a classical rule-based method with a Deep
Learning method for automatic classification of ECG for
participation in PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge 2020. Six databases are considered for training
set. They consist 43101 12-leads ECG recording, lasting
from 6 to 60 seconds considering 24 diagnostic classes.
The rule-based method is using morphological and
time-frequency ECG descriptors, characterizing each
diagnostic labels. These rules have been extracted from the
knowledge-base of a physician, with no direct learning
procedure in the first phase, while a refinement have been
tested in the second phase. The Deep Learning method
consider both raw ECG signals and median beat signals.
These data are processed by continuous wavelet transform
analysis
obtaining
a
time-frequency
domain
representtation, with the generation of specific images.
These images are used for training Convolutional Neural
Networks for ECG diagnostic classification. Official result
of the classification accuracy of the ECGs Test set of our
team named 'Gio_Ivo' produced a challenge validation
score of 0.325 for the rule based method, and a 0.426 for
the Deep learning methodology with GoogleNet, which
was chosen for the final score, obtaining a full test score
of 0.298, placing us 12th out of 41 in the official ranking.

Introduction

Over the years, we have developed methods for
detection, accurate localization of ECG waves and
automatic diagnosis. For example, different methods have
been tested for detection and identification QRS and Twaves and QT interval [1 - 5], for the classification of the
heart beats [6, 7] and for the classification of diagnoses of
cardiac abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation or
myocardial infarction [8 - 10]
Similarly, several techniques of learning with Neural

Networks approach or direct learning process from a set of
extracted parameters from the analysis of ECG signal were
performed and tested [11 - 13].
The main objective of this study is to test these two
different techniques of automatic classification of ECG
signals with the participation to the PhysioNet/CinC_2020
Challenge. Then, to the classical rule-based system
method, a new technique based on direct learning from
ECG raw data through the Deep Learning methods are
explored and compared in the same framework.

Challenge database

The Challenge provided a dataset with annotated 43101
12-leads ECG recordings lasting from 6 to 60 seconds.
[14]. The initial 107 diagnoses were further reduced to the
27
diagnostic
classes
considered
in
the
Physionet/Challenge scoring system (see Table 3 in [14]
for a full list of the diagnoses and codes). They reduce to
24 considering 3 equivalent classes. The six considered
dataset for the learning phase consists of:
1. DB1- 6,877 recordings from China Physiological Signal
Challenge in 2018
2. DB2- 3,453 recordings from China 12-Lead ECG
Challenge.
3. DB3- 74 recordings from the St Petersburg INCART
12-lead Arrhythmia
4. DB4- 516 recordings from the PTB Diagnostic ECG.
5. DB5- 21,837 recordings from the PTB-XL
electrocardiography Database
6. DB6- 10,344 recordings from a Georgia 12-Lead ECG
Challenge
All ECG data are resampled at 500 Hz (if necessary)
for compatibility purposes.
This large dataset is consisting for a total of 43101 ECG
recordings and 60373 diagnostic instances.
A random selection of ECG records with at most N_max
instances for all the 24 considered diagnostic classes were
determined for a more equilibrated distribution of their
consistency and for a more efficient learning phase,

characterized by the QRS angle in the range [180, -44]. In
addition, LAnFB (Left anterior fascicular block) is
characterized by RAD=1 or LAD =1 and by the presence
of small Q-waves with tall R-waves in lead I and small R
waves with deep S waves in leads II, III.

obtaining the following subsets:
S16K: N_max=1000 produces 16002 ECG records
S20K: N_max=1500 produces 20.044 ECG records
S11K: N_max=600 produces 11210 ECG records.
Table 1 reports the distribution of the 60373 diagnostic
instances present in the entire database, and the weighted
number of records of the subset S16K, consisting of 16002
ECG records.

Method

The ECG recordings are filtered to eliminate the powerline interference, the drift of the zero-line and the
electromyographic noise (EMG). QRS detection using
combined adaptive threshold [1] is performed. Then a
robust average beat is calculated, with reference to the
most distinguished positive (R), or negative (S) peaks, by
signal-averaging of the sustained beats in the record. The
rejected outliers are suspected as artifacts or abnormal
beats with non-sustained amplitudes.

3.1

Rule-based method

The rule-based method uses morphological and timefrequency ECG â€“VCG descriptors, characterizing each
diagnostic labels. Orthogonal (X, Y, Z) leads were derived
by transverse formulas of Dower, [15]. These rules have
been extracted from the knowledge-base of a physician,
with no direct learning procedure in the first phase, while
a refinement has been tested in the second phase.
The way to determine some diagnosis is shown below.
In case P-wave does not exist, the number of waves
between two QRS in lead II is computed, by counting the
number of zero line crossings of the first derivative as
shown in Fig. 1. In case of Count>9, AFL=1 (atrial flutter),
and in case Count>15, AF=1 (atrial fibrillation),
The QRS-angle in frontal plane was calculated. LAD
(left axis deviation) is characterized by QRS angle in the

Deep Learning Networks

The Deep Learning method considers both raw ECG
signals and median beat signals. These data are processed
by continuous wavelet transform analysis obtaining a timefrequency domain representation, with the generation of
specific images. These images are then used for training
Convolutional Neural Networks for ECG diagnostic
classification. Pretrained image CNN classification
network that has already learned to extract powerful and
informative features from natural images has been used as
a starting point to learn a new classification task [16].
Two pre-trained CNN for image classification have
been initially used, GoogleNet and SqueezeNet networks.
These are models pretrained on a subset of the ImageNet
database, which is used in the ImageNet Large-Scale
Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [16 - 18]. Both
networks have been tested in the first phase, while the
GoogleNet was used in the second phase considering the
better performance.
GoogleNet is a convolutional neural network
characterized by 22 layers, and it is pretrained to classify
images into 1000 object categories Each layer can be
considered as a filter, consequently the first ones
characterize more common features while the deeper ones
characterize more specific features in order to differentiate
the considered diagnostic classes.
In order to capture time-frequency representations of a
particular window of the ECG signal with an image, the
Continuous Wavelet Tranform CWT have been used. In

particular, the absolute values of the CWT coefficients of
the considered ECG signal have been considered,
obtaining the so called scalogram [16].
Two examples of scalogram are reported in Fig. 2
(Premature Atrial Contraction PAC) and in Fig. 3 (Normal
Sinus Rhythm NSR), where the x axis represent the time,
the y axis the frequency, and the color is the magnitude.

Particular techniques have been developed in order to
adapt the general task to this particular problem:
- duplication of records in the learning set in order
to have a more uniform and balanced distribution
of the diagnostic classes
- the learning process of the Deep Learning method
was adapted in order to cope with multiple
diagnoses classification (comorbidity)
- the ECG signal is defined by two components of 8
independent leads:
a. 10 seconds of ECG signal
b. Average beats computed previously in the
rule-bases block.

Results and Discussion

The score indices of the first and second phase of the
Challenge (validation scores) are defined and reported in
[14], and F-score (F_2) and G-score (G_2) and F-measure
(F_meas) are considered. Our team named 'Gio_Ivo'
participated successfully to the unofficial and official
phases of the Challenge.
In the first phase the learning process was based only of
the database DB1 consisting of 6877 ECG records with 9
possible diagnostic classes. Table 2. Reports the official
indices. For the Deep Learning method, a matlab platformrelated error was present and for this reason crossvalidation indices on the database DB1 are reported.
Table 3 reports cross validation indices of the tested
algorithms considering the learning database DB1.

In the second phase, the official Challenge, the number
of the diagnostic classes indicated increased to the number
of 110, but the scoring system was essentially concentrated
to a subset of 27 classes, which reduced to 24 considering
3 equivalent classes. In order to increase the efficiency of
the learning process, the subset S16K (16002 records,
Table 1) was mainly used.
The Deep Learning process was performed and tested
by cross-validation techniques. However, in the submitted

algorithm, the learning was performed with one fold for the
relevant duration of the learning process and feedback
phase (for the presence of several platform-related
problems).
Table 4 reports the official Challenge Validation score
of the submitted algorithms. The rule-based method RB1
essentially did not use any learning process from the
database S16K and the score is in agreement with the
behaviour of the first phase., while the second version
(RB2) try to use extract some information from S16K. For
example, it tried to differentiate AF from AFL by the AFwaves frequency and amplitude, but the consequent
improvement was not significant.
Different Deep Learning algorithm were submitted,
with different learning subsets (S16K, S20K, S11K) and
different number of iterations, but the score (Table 4) were
all in the range [0.400, 0.426], indicating that all these
algorithms have a similar behaviour. In particular,
GoogleNet 6 resume the training from a previously saved
pre-trained network which comes from a 3-fold crossvalidation technique on S16K and 10 iterations.
Table 5 reports Cross validation indices tested in the
database S16K. It is interesting to note that the reported
indices F_2, G_2 and the normalized score in agreement
with the official results, with some more optimistic results,
probably depending by the composition of the unknown
test set.
The final official results of our team named 'Gio_Ivo'
performed on the Deep Learning method GoogleNet 6,
achieved a challenge validation score of 0.426 and a full
test score of 0.298 placing us 12th out of 41 in the official
ranking.
