Abstract

Automated cardiac abnormality detection from an everexpanding number of electrocardiogram (ECG) records
has been widely used to assist physicians in the clinical
diagnosis of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Over
the last few years, deep learning (DL) architectures have
achieved state-of-the-art performances in various biomedical applications. In this work, we propose a bio-toolkit
based on the DL framework comprising stacked convolutional and long short term memory neural network blocks
for multi-label ECG signal classification. Our team participated under the name “Cardio-Challengers” in the “PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020” and obtained a challenge metric score of 0.337 in the validation
data set and 0.258 in the full test data, placing us 16th out
of 41 teams in the official ranking.

Introduction

Globally, cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for
over 31% of deaths around the world [1], while sudden
cardiac deaths statistics projects over 80% of them to be
closely related to cardiac arrhythmias [2]. Electrocardiography (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed over the skin. ECG is a widely used
technique for arrhythmia detection, and analyzing the abnormal ECG waveforms or rhythms can predict the morbid
status of the cardiovascular system [3]. Early-stage clinical diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities such as cardiac arrhythmias can increase the chances of heart patient’s survival by predicting cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, manual interpretation of ECG is subjective,
tedious, and domain-expertise dependent. Deep learning
allows unconventional ways to interpret ECG signal exploration computer-aided diagnosis by relieving hand-crafted
feature engineering for clinical setting deployment.

Problem definition

The “PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge
2020” seeks to classify 12-lead ECG recordings for diagnosis of CVDs [4]. The contestants are required to plan
and device a working, open-source model which can automatically categorize the various multi-label cardiac abnormalities present in each of the 12-lead ECG signals based
on the provided clinical data only. The ranking is based on
the challenge metric score obtained on the hidden test set.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
related works. Section 3 describes methodology: preprocessing, ECG template extraction, and proposed deep
learning model. Experimental results and discussion are
presented in section 4 and section 5 concludes the paper.

Related works

Traditionally, ECG classification is done on the basis of
expert features [5]. Using computer algorithms these features are automatically extracted. Several researchers are
trying to come up with promising sets of expert features
but they are limited by quality of data and human expert
knowledge. Recently deep learning has achieved promising results in various domains like computer vision, image
classification and speech recognition.
Zihlmann et al. studied the deep CNN (24 layer CNN)
along with the combination of CNN and LSTM on the
same ECG data set, but they achieved a better accuracy
with the combination of CNN and LSTM (24 layer CNN
+ 3 layer LSTM) [6]. Warrick et al. reduced the complexity of the network and modelled it in two main components : representation learning (using CNN) and sequence
learning (using LSTM)[7]. The network has three layers of
LSTM stacked above the one layer of CNN. Riberio et al.,
12- lead ECG was used for the classification of six cardiac
abnormalities using Deep Neural Network (DNN) called
as residual networks which were adapted for unidimen-

and is loosely inspired by [6], [7], [8] where the combinations of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long
Short term Memory (LSTM) were studied.

plemented a DNN based model using the Keras library of
the python programming language. The hidden layers of
the model have two CNN-1D layers and two LSTM layers
along with the input and the output layer. Figure 1 depicts
the proposed pipeline and Fig. 2 shows the deep learning
framework explored for automated ECG classification.

ECG Pre-Processing

3.3.1. Input layer

The training set provided by the Physionet/Computing
in Cardiology Challenge 2020 [4] comprises 43101, 12lead ECG recordings. Amongst the 12 leads, lead II being
a bipolar lead with its electrodes placed on the right arm
and left leg, is mostly used for identifying cardiac arrhythmias owing to its proximity to the cardiac axis and it encompasses the best view of the P and R waves [9], [10].
Hence, we selected lead II for further processing. Signals
are pre-processed to remove the baseline wander, muscle
artifacts and high frequency noise by using finite impulse
response (FIR) bandpass filter with a passband in the 3-45
Hz frequency range.

3.2.

Template Extraction

From Lead II, the R peaks were captured using Hamilton algorithm [11]. The signal between the R peaks is considered which incorporates the P and T waves of the ECG
signal. Each cardiac cycle is re-sampled to 400 samples
and averaged over each subject. This generates a subject
wise averaged cardiac cycle. The average cardiac cycle is
split in two equal parts and swapped to generate the templates.The templates were normalized in amplitude with
respect to the maximum absolute value of the individual
template. Representative ECG templates extracted from
the Lead II ECG Signals are shown in Fig. 6.

Model Overview

In the paper we have proposed, an ECG classifier based
1-dimensional CNN (CNN-1D) and LSTM. We have im-

In ECG pre-processing, the templates of shape (400 x 1)
were generated and given as input to the CNN layer.

3.3.2. CNN-1D layer
CNN is one of the most popular neural network architectures and 1D CNN has been widely used for classification
of time series data, for example, to classify cardiovascular
abnormality using ECG signal [12], [13]. 1D CNN layers
are capable to extract the features from a short segment of
the raw signal, where the features do not depend upon the
location within the segment. The CNN are used for image
data but in unidimensional data it is efficient in capturing
the spatial information. This has made it a prime choice
for our model. The CNN model has n number of kernels
(or filters) of size pxq, where p will be smaller than the
input length. Each filter convolves with the input to create
a feature map. In our model, we used two layers of CNN,
where, each of the layers has 64 filters of size 4x1 and a
stride of 1.

3.3.3. LSTM layer
LSTM is one kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [14]. It is also
suitable for the classification of time series data, speech
recognition, handwriting recognition, etc. LSTM layers
have the ability to remember patterns in the data for long
duration. They are efficient in capturing the temporal dependencies. In our model we have used two LSTM layers, the first layer has 32 units and the second layer has 12

units.

3.3.4. Output layer
The output layer is a densely connected neural network
layer with an output size of 27x1. In order to get the probabilistic output from the model, the sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer. The output shows the probability of occurrence of each class. An optimum threshold
is applied at the output to get output in binary fashion. 1
shows the presence of class and 0 shows the absence of the
class. In this way we computed the multi label output.

Results and Discussion

Experiment Design

The training and testing data is split in 4:1 ratio. We
have used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005
and the binary cross-entropy loss function to compile the
model. During the training of the model, the batch size is
256 and the number of epochs is 1000. We used an early
stopping criterion based on the loss in each epoch. If the
loss was not decreasing for 8 consecutive epochs the training ended. During the training of the model, we also calculated the best possible threshold value for each class that
later we used during testing.

Model Compilation Results

The DNN based model received the challenge metric [4]
score of 0.337 when we used a threshold optimizer. For a
fixed threshold value of 0.005 the Challenge metric score
was 0.314.
From the physionet challenge site we collected 43101
data files and extracted templates from them. After removing the samples with the NaN values, we had 42920
files. We used 64% of the available samples for training,
16% for validation of the model and the remaining 20% for
testing. Figure 3 shows the loss for the training and validation dataset. Figure 5 shows the corresponding F1 score
and Fig. 4 shows the variation in accuracy with the training epoch. Table 1 tabulates the score for different scoring
metrics, including the challenge metric for the validation
and test database.

Discussion

Figure 6 shows ECG templates for NSR (Normal synus
rhythm), AF (Atrial fibrillation), I-AVB (1st degree AV
block) and LAnFB (Left anterior fascicular block) classes.
Here we have considered only four classes to explain the
physiological features using the templates. AF, having

most prevalent pathologic tachyarrhythmia, shows no Pwave and ST-depression in the ECG signal[15]. The abnormal delay of the impulse from the atria to the ventricles termed as I-AVB [16]. This leads to a prolonged PRinterval (≥ 0.22s). One of the major ECG criterion for
LAnFB is the rS-QRS complex (initially a small positive
R wave followed by a large negative S wave) [17], [18].
All the above discussed ECG features are distinguishable
from the ECG templates shown in the Fig. 6.

Conclusions

In this study, we proposed a classifier based on the combination of CNN and LSTM. The output of our model is
multi label which strengthen our solution. Due to low
complexity of the model, it can be used in real time applications. In the multi-label classification some classes
were better classified and had a higher F1 score whereas
some classes were poorly classified. This was mainly because the data was biased. The threshold optimizer helped
in setting the optimal threshold for each class and hence
gave better classification results. On a futuristic scope, the
authors are working to improve the classification output.
