Abstract
In this study we present a system for automated
processing of signals from the polysomnogram (PSG) for
the detection of apnoea and non-apnoea arousals. The
PSG signals were divided into 15 second epochs and 59
time- and frequency-domain features were derived for
each epoch. Features from adjacent 4 epochs were
combined and processed with a bank of ten feed-forward
neural networks each with a single hidden layer of 20
units. The system outputs a 200 Hz annotation signal
containing probability estimates that each sample was
associated with an apnoea or non-apnoea arousal, or noarousal. Data from the Physionet Computing in
Cardiology Challenge 2018 was used to develop and test
the system. Performance of the system was assessed using
three class and two class metrics. With the system
classifying three classes, the volume under the receiver
operator characteristic (ROC) surface was 0.75 with an
optimal specificity of 0.72, a sensitivity of 0.76 for the
apnoea arousals, and a sensitivity of 0.69 for the nonapnoea arousals. When the two arousal classes were
combined into one arousal class, the area under the
precision recall curve was 0.74, the area under the ROC
curve was 0.91, with an optimal specificity and sensitivity
of 0.85.

Introduction

A wide range of negative health outcomes including
neurocognitive disorders, mood and mental conditions,
cardiovascular disease [1], hypertension and stroke [2] are
associated with low quality sleep. Poor sleep is also an
established contributor to workplace and road accidents
[3]. While arousals are a normal feature of the sleep/wake
cycle, an excessive number of arousals can lead to poor
sleep quality [4-6]. Respiration interruptions during sleep
are a common cause of arousals. These interruptions
include obstructive apnoea and hypopnoea events,
respiratory effort related arousals and other interruptions
to breathing. Arousals can also be caused by snoring,
muscle jerks, pain, and insomnia.

The most common way to provide a detailed
assessment of sleep is to record a polysomnogram (PSG)
which provides range of signals from a sleeping patient
[7]. Sleep technicians then manually assess the PSG. Part
of their analysis includes scoring arousals which is a timeconsuming manual task. Automated software that
processes the PSG information and assists the technician
in identifying arousals would clearly be of benefit and is
the topic of this paper.
The PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge
2018 [8] provided the framework for researchers to
develop and test automatic algorithms for the detection of
non-apnoea arousals from the PSG and we were one of the
participating teams [9,10]. For the purposes of the
Challenge apnoea-related arousals were ignored which
limited the clinical application of the resulting algorithms.
In this current study we address this application issue and
extend the capability of our system to detect apnoea
arousals. Our resulting system potentially has greater
clinical application.

Input data

The data used in this study dataset was provided by the
2018
Challenge
organisers
(https://physionet.org/
challenge) and is publicly available. It includes 994
overnight PSG study recordings and associated sleep,
respiratory event and arousal annotations [8]. All
recordings were acquired at the Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) sleep laboratories.

Signals and expert scorings

The signals include the airflow, electrocardiogram,
electroencephalogram (EEG), chin electromyogram
(EMG), electrooculogram (EOG), pulse oximetry (SpO2)
and respiratory effort signals. All signals were sampled at
200Hz. Standard sleep and respiratory events were scored
by MGH staff. They also determined the time, duration
and cause of all arousal events. Arousals were then
grouped into apnoea related arousals and non-apnoea
related arousals. Apnoea arousals included central, mixed
and obstructive apnoeas and hypopnoeas. Non-apnoea

related arousals included breathing, bruxisms, CheyneStokes hypoventilations, partial airway obstructions,
periodic leg movement, respiratory event related arousals,
snores, spontaneous arousals, and vocalisations
Based on the arousal events, a target vector sampled at
200Hz was established for every PSG recording by the
Challenge organisers. The target values for the nonapnoea arousals were set to “1”. The target values of the
apnoea (hypopnoea)-arousals were set to “-1”. The target
value for the non-arousals sections were set to “0” [8].

Methods

We adopted the same feature extraction framework as
previously used by us in the 2018 Challenge. Features
were extracted from 15 second time windows of data as
previously we had shown that this provided the longest
epoch length that maintained satisfactory precision of the
arousal annotations. The epoch-based annotations needed
for the training algorithms were determined from the
200Hz arousal annotations by sampling the arousal
annotations at the midpoint of every 15 seconds epoch [9].

Figure 1 shows an outline of our proposed system. It
processes SpO2, EMG chin, EOG, respiratory effort,
airflow, and EEG signals from the overnight PSG
recordings. The system first removes artefacts from
signals and normalizes signals. Following this, the system
divides the signals into 15 second epochs, calculate
features per epoch, combines features from adjacent
epochs, classifies each epoch using a bank of classifiers
and then finds a combined classifier output for each
epoch. The final step in the process is to upsample the
epoch annotations to a 200Hz output signal. The
annotation per sample is one of “no arousal”, ”apnoea
arousal” or “non-apnoea arousal”.

Features and epoch combiner

The features extracted per epoch from the PSG are
shown in Table 1. Full details of the feature extraction
methods are provided in [9].
The system was provided with the ability to look
forward/backwards in time by up to one minute for signal
changes associated with the arousals. This was achieved
by combining features from four epochs either side of the

stage. Four epochs were c hosen as previous work by us
[11] had shown this provided good performance.

3.3.

Classifiers and upsampler

Two classifiers were used to provide a performance
comparison. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
classifier [12], and bank of 10 single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (FFNN) [13] each with 20 hidden
units. Both classifiers had a softmax output stage that
provided three probability outputs of non-arousal, apnoea
arousal and non-aponea arousal for every epoch. The LDA
classifier was fast to train, while the FFNN classifier had
provided superior performance in the 2018 Physionet
Challenge [9]. The FFNN was trained with a crossentropy cost function.
The outputs of the bank of FFNN classifiers were
combined by averaging the probability estimates of the ten
individual classifiers.
The final stage was to upsample the epoch
classifications to the 200Hz sample rate of the event based
annotations using a first order hold filter.

Performance estimation

Performance was estimated using 10-fold crossvalidation. The 994 records were randomly divided into
ten sets containing 99 or 100 records. Nine sets were used
to train the system and the remaining set used to test
performance. The sets were then rotated and the combined
performance results on the test sets calculated.
Performance was measured using several metrics. First,
3×3 confusion matrices were calculated over the complete
range of decision thresholds for the three classes. The
specificity and sensitivity results from the confusion
matrices were then used as inputs to a three-way receiver
operator characteristic (ROC) analysis [14]. A summary
performance measure was calculated by finding the
volume under ROC surface (VUROS) which is the 3 class
equivalent of the area under the ROC curve (AUROC).
The three-way ROC was also used to find optimal
specificity and sensitivity points by finding the point on
the surface that minimized the Euclidean distance to the
ideal performance point of (1 1 1). The sensitivity and
positive predictive results from the 3×3 confusion
matrices were used to perform a Precision-Recall curve

analysis of the two arousal classes [15]. Performance was
assessed using area under the curves (AUPRC).
Second, the cell entries of the two arousal classes in the
3×3 confusion matrices were combined, producing a 2×2
confusion matrices representing the performance at each
decision threshold for a system classifying “non-arousal”
and “arousal”. The AUROC, AUPRC and optimal
specificity and sensitivity points were calculated from the
2×2 confusion matrices.

Results and discussion

Table 2 shows the key results for the two classifiers.
The performance of the FFNN outperformed the LDA in
all measures. For the three class results, the FFNN
classifier achieved a VUROS of 0.75, a specificity of
72%, an apnoea arousal sensitivity of 76% and a nonapnoea arousal of 69%. The AUPRC was 0.18 and 0.76
for the non-apnoea arousal and apnoea-arousal class
respectively. Our results suggest that our algorithm detects
apnoea-arousals more effectively than non-apnoea
arousals. Possible reasons are that apnoea arousals
occurred more frequently in the database than the nonapnoea arousals. Also, non-apnoea arousals have diverse
causes which results in greater heterogeneity of signals.
Figure 2 shows the test-set 3-way ROC surface with the
optimum performance point indicated. Table 3 shows the
normalised confusion matrix for the three classes at the
optimum point determined from the ROC surface. It
shows that non-arousal and the apnoea arousal classes
tended to be misclassified as the non-apnoea arousal class
with false detection rates of 0.22 and 0.18 respectively.
After combining the two arousal classes into one class, the
AUROC was 0.91 with an optimal specificity/sensitivity
of 0.85, and an AUPRC of 0.74 (see Tables 2 and 4).
There are several areas for future work. Our system
used 531 features which very likely includes some highly
correlated features, so feature selection may yield a
smaller higher performing system. The highest performing
architectures from the 2018 Physionet Challenge included
convolutional neural network stages and used minimally
processed sensor data. Adopting similar architectures may
yield performance gains.

Discussion and Conclusion

We’ve presented a system for automated annotation of
selected signals from the PSG for the presence of apnoea
and non-aponea arousals. Our best system used a bank of
10 feed-forward neural networks and achieved a volume
under the ROC surface of 0.75 with a specificity of 72%, a
sensitivity of 76% for the apnoea arousals, and a
sensitivity of 69% for the non-apnoea arousals. When the
two arousal classes were combined into one it achieved an
AUROC of 0.91 and an AUPRC of 0.74.
