Abstract
The growing demand for diagnosing of cardiovascular
diseases leads to the development of new solutions for
automatic classification of recorded ECG signals.
Creating a robust and fast algorithm for automatic
classification of ECG signal is crucial to improve the
quality of healthcare, especially in countries where a lack
of experienced specialists is an issue or the healthcare
system
is
overloaded.
The
aim
of
the
PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 is to
create an algorithm for classification of 12-lead ECGs
based on ECG signals from multiple databases across the
world. The shared training set consisted of 43,101 ECG
recordings lasting from 5 to 1800 seconds. We (BioS
Team) proposed the machine learning algorithm based on
convolutional neural networks. The ECG signals were
pre-processed using moving median filters to remove
high-frequency noise and baseline wandering. We
developed simply convolutional neural network consisting
of four main convolutional blocks and one fully connected
layer. We achieved a challenge validation score of 0.349,
and full test score of 0.279, placing us 14 out of 41 in the
official ranking.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause
of death worldwide, killing about 17.9 million lives each
year (WHO, 2016). A Standard tool for diagnosing of
many CVDs is 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). In a
traditional way, 12-ECG records are interpreted by
cardiologists manually based on diagnosis criteria and
personal experience. However, manual interpretation of
the recordings is time-consuming and requires high
degree of skills. The growing demand for diagnostic
testing is leading to the development of new solutions for
automatic classification of recorded signals.
Since late 1950s, the performance of automatic
algorithm for ECG interpretation were grown with

computational capacity of the computers and developing
new methods of analysis, preprocessing and classification
[1]. Many algorithms are based on three processes:
feature extraction, feature selection, and classification [2].
The alternative way is to use the machine learning
methods, e.g.: convolutional neural networks (CNN),
which do not need prior defined features and take to the
input the raw (or preprocessed) signal [3].
Development of automatic ECG classifier was the aim
of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020
[4]. Participants had to deal with the problem of creating
an algorithm that recognizes 27 classes using multiple
databases from across the world.
In this article we present an algorithm for multilabel
classification using machine learning method based on
the (CNN). We described the details of the algorithm,
necessary for reproducing, and showed its limitations and
suggestions for its improvement.

Data

The data, shared for the training, came from 4
sources: CPSC – database from the China Physiological
Signal Challenge 2018 (CPSC2018) [5], INCART public dataset from the St. Petersburg Institute of
Cardio-logical Technics (Russia) [6,7], PTB
and
PTB-XL - Physikalisch
Technische
Bundesanstalt
(PTB) Database, Brunswick, German [8,9] and G12EC Georgia 12-leadECG Challenge (G12EC) Database,
Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Total
number of recordings from these databases was 43,101.
Each recording contains, apart from ECG signals,
information about age, sex and diagnoses. From total
number of 111 diagnoses, only 27 were considered by the
scoring system (all classes are listed in [4]). The
recordings differ in regard to the duration (5-1800 s,
mean: 15.8±75.9 s) and sample frequency (257-1000 Hz).

Preprocessing

The architecture of our model is shown in Figure 2.
We used two-dimensional convolutional neural network
for pre-processed 12-lead ECG signal. The architecture
consisted of four convolutional blocks followed by a fully
connected layer. In each convolutional block there was
double two-dimensional convolution operations followed
by ReLU activation functions, max-pooling layer and
dropout layer (10% of dropout), except for the last block
where max-pooling was not used because maximum level
of compression of the data was achieved. In all four
blocks 8, 16, 32, 64 convolution filters were used,
respectively. The size of convolution kernels in all
convolutional layers was set to 3x3. We used the “same”
size of the zero padding in convolutional layers so that
the layer output has the same size as the input. The maxpooling with size 2x2 and stride of 2 was used to reduce
the dimension of each convolutional block output.
The number of neurons in fully connected layer was
equal to the number of classes (27). The sigmoid
activation (instead of softmax) was applied to all output
values from last fully connected layer. The signal was
classified as the categories whose sigmoid output value
exceeded 0.35.
We chose L2 regularization as a regularization
technique in addition to dropout. We set L2 regularization
factor to 0.06.
We trained out network for 30 epochs with mini-batch
size equal 1024. The training data set was randomly split
into 80% training and 20% validation. Classification was
carried out using categorical-cross-entropy loss function
and ADAM optimizer with the following parameters:
learning rate = 0.001, epsilon = 0.001, beta1 = 0.9,
beta2 = 0.9.
Network architecture and hyperparameters were finetuned manually through a limited trial and error process.
We have not tried to test many other potentially good
models, neither with similar nor very different
architecture. All hyperparameter values for the proposed
network are summarized in Table 1.
The model was developed and implemented in
MATLAB 2020a environment. To train our network we
used so-called Custom Training Loop to implement
mutually non-exclusive classification (more than one
class can occur in a single ECG recording, e.g., sinus
rhythm and single premature ventricular contraction,
PVC).

Initially all signals are resampled to 100 Hz and cut at
10 s (if any signal was shorter it is copied enough times to
fill in 10 seconds). Next, the processing is done in two
steps:
• each channel the signals are smoothened using
moving median filter with window of 5 samples.
• signals are detrended by subtracting a moving mean
with window size of 50 samples.
Next, input to the CNN network as 2D matrix was
prepared. The subsequent ECG leads were placed in the
rows of this matrix. Graphical representation of the input
matrix was presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Example of the 10-secods ECG signal from the
Lead 1 (upper) and single data input to the CNN network
consisted of the 12 ECG leads merged in one 2D matrix.

Discussion

The method used in this work can be regarded as a
relatively simply convolutional neural network with a
superficial preprocessing as the network consisted of 4
main convolutional blocks and 1 fully connected layer
only. Similar networks has been used for a wide variety
of problems before and, here, for ECG arrythmias, it has
shown moderate performance of 0.349 (the challenge
metric) on the hidden test set. The challenge score
obtained from this set is smaller than the score calculated
for the data shared for training. It may suggest that the
model is overfitting and additional steps for increasing
generalization abilities of the classification model.
Despite its simple architecture and limited overall
performance, some significant observations can be made.
The performance of classification varied for different
types of arrythmias. The best performance was obtained
for AF, LBBB, PR, RBBB, SNR, and STach. On the
other hand, the classifier totally failed to detect some
other arrythmias such as CRBBB, LAnFB, LQRSV,
NSIVCB, PVC, RAD, SA, SVPB, TInv, and VPB. There
are few reasons for that. Some of the weakest-performing
classes were significantly underrepresented in the dataset.

Few other classes were cardiac malfunctions where a
single pathological pattern occurs in the ECG signal.
Taking into account the fact that the signal analysis was
limited to 10 seconds only, any other result for these
classes could not be expected.
The main limitation of this work was using the first 10
seconds of the signal which was the time covering 83% of
the signals from the available dataset. Such a procedure
was determined by the computational time requirements
which were cumbersome when using a single PC
machine.

A serious potential improvement has been prepared for
this approach and scored well on the validation set,
however, it could not be scored on the hidden test set due
to the computational time excess. The improvement was
based on the many-source CNN approach and consisted
of separate networks for: (i) ECG signals themselves, (ii)
RR intervals, and (iii) mean beats of the signal.
Additionally, the first 2 minutes of each record were used
for the analysis.

Conclusions

We (BioS Team) proposed model for 12-lead ECG
model based on convolutional neural networks full test
score of 0.279 (14th place out of 41 in the official ranging
of the Challenge). The model may be the first attempt for
the further, more complex versions using longer ECG
signals as an input and multiple inputs data (such as
averaged beat or RR intervals analysis).
Despite obvious limitations, the method used in this
work proved versatility of the convolutional neural
network approach and its capability and usability for
biomedical signal tools and analysis.
