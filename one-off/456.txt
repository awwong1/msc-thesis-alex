Abstract

Heart abnormalities cause about 26 % of the deaths of
illnesses in the world. Developing computational tools for
ECG interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical
diagnosis of Cardiac arrhythmias (CAs). Aims: This study
aimed to develop an automated abnormal pattern
recognition method for clinical decision support capable
of detecting between 27 possible CAs. Proposal: An
improved deep learning (DL) model was employed using
raw-data and time-frequency representation (TFR)
images. Methods: A vast set of ECG records were filtered
and normalized. They were segmented and transformed
into two sets of 2-D images. TFR images were obtained
through Wavelet Synchrosqueezing (WS). The VGG-16
network was chosen, modifying the weights of the inner
layers to adapt the model to the CAs detection task. A 10fold cross-validation method was executed. Different
training hyperparameters were tested to find the best
model. Results: With the cross-validation on the training
data, the model developed by our team UIDT-UNAM
performed identifying CAs, with an overall unofficial Sscore of 0.766. This model had a high performance in
detecting healthy subjects with an F1 score of 0.83. We
obtained these results using only the public training
dataset. We plan to test these optimistic results with
Physionet private dataset very soon.

Introduction

Heart abnormalities are the first cause of death for
illnesses worldwide [1]. Cardiac arrhythmias (CAs) are the
most frequent causes of them and contribute to
approximately 15% to 20% of all deaths [2].
The standard 12-lead ECG is the most commonly used
to diagnose cardiac abnormalities [3]. The early detection
of CAs and its treatment for sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs)
prevention, represents a significant opportunity to reduce
mortality further [1]. However, ECG manual interpretation
is slow, requires training personnel with a high degree of
technical knowledge, and suffers subjectivity.
Physicians detect the action potentials of the signals and

analyses the absence of P wave, morphologies irregular of
QRS complexes, and irregularity of the segments. Recent
results have shown that physicians have an accuracy rate
of 75% in the detection procedure of some CAs [4].
Computational tools that using automatic detection and
classification of CAs can assist physicians in the ECG
diagnosis. Recently, there have been increasing numbers
of research focused on 12-lead ECG classification through
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms.
Theoretically, many of these algorithms have been
accurate in the identification of CAs. However, the
successful result of those tests is a consequence of using
small and homogeneous datasets. The Physionet/CinC
2020 challenge has provided a vast dataset for this purpose
[5].

Material and methods

The CAs detection method proposed here consists of the
following stages: ECG data pre-processing (noise removal
and data segmentation) and CAs classification (Signals
transformation and final classification). In the first stage,
the wavelet transform (WT) method was applied to denoise
the ECG signal. Then, the signals were segmented in equal
periods of duration, taking into account the signal
morphology. In the second stage, the Wavelet
synchrosqueezing (WS) method was applied to obtain the
time-frequency representation (TFR) images, and the
images of the raw signals were obtained. Finally, the
arrangement of parallel convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) based on VGG-16 was trained from scratch to
identify 27 types of CAs.

2.1. Data set
Six public datasets of 12-leads ECG records coming
from four different sources were used [5]. The datasets
have a total of 111 identified CAs, of which just 27 general
classes were chosen to be assessed [5]. The dataset was
divided randomly into three sets, training, validation, and
local testing, with 70 %, 15 %, and 15 % of the data,
respectively.

2.3.

Signals denoising and segmentation

Signals were purged, and irrelevant information was
discarded. A denoising process was performed to eliminate
outside signals related to the sampling procedure. The
Wavelet transform (WT) method was used for this purpose
with the Daubechies4 (db4) function since it allows
decomposing the input signal into low and high-frequency
components [5].
Each file in each dataset contains the information
corresponding to the 12-leads ECG. The first 6 s of each of
the entire dataset signals were segmented in time intervals
of 1.2 s. This interval size allows obtaining the relevant
information around each peak, regardless of the type of CA
that the patient presents, thus having each cycle of beats.

two representation types shown here. Then, it is possible to
observe notable differences both in each class and to each
kind of representation

Signals and TFR images

Both sets of images were constructed by taking the
segments of each signal. First, the segments were plotted
as time series and saved as 64 x 64 greyscale images. The
second set was built by transforming the signals using the
WS method to obtain the TF features. With these features,
the TFR images were obtained (see Fig. 2 b), d), and f)).
The WS method used for TFR is based on the
continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
[6]. In this
transformation, concentrated high-resolution TF patterns
are obtained, from which instantaneous frequency lines
can be identified. The instantaneous frequency 𝜔(𝑎, 𝑏) for
any point (𝑎, 𝑏) of the original signal with 𝑊𝑎,𝑏 ≠ 0 is
given by:
−1 𝜕
𝜔𝑎,𝑏 = −𝑖(𝑊𝑎,𝑏 )
𝑊
(1)
𝜕𝑏 𝑎,𝑏
Where 𝑎, 𝑏 and 𝑊𝑎,𝑏 are the scale factor, translational
value, and WT, respectively. From this instantaneous
frequency, the Synchrosqueezing discrete transform is
determined at a local frequency point given by the
transformation [6]:
𝑇𝜔𝑙 ,𝑏 = (∆𝜔𝑎,𝑏 )

Finally, the representation of the signal in the TF space
at high resolution is obtained. Fig. 1 shows both the raw
signal and the TFR of three different types of CAs with the
same window length of 1.2 s.
Different features can be observed for each segment,
especially the amplitude in the TFR and the morphology in
the raw signal images. The representation of the signal
segments in these two types of images gives relevant
information no longer observed when using only one of the

As a result, we obtained 120 images for each patient
from the arrhythmia datasets used here.

Deep learning model

CNNs have proven useful for automatic feature
extraction in detecting abnormal patterns in clinical images
without pre-processing algorithms or manual intervention
[7].
A CNN is composed of an input and an output layer and
many hidden layers composed of convolutional, pooling,
and fully connected (FC) layers. The convolutional layers
are locally connected to extract the features by applying a
set of weights called kernels. The ReLU function for an
input value 𝑥 is generally used as activation functions and
is defined as:
0,
𝑓(𝑥) = {
𝑥,

𝑖𝑓 𝑥 < 0
𝑖𝑓 𝑥 ≥ 0

(3)

Relevant high-level features can be extracted with an
increasing number of convolutional layers. The weights of
the convolutional kernel parameters in each layer are
trained with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm [8].

2.4.1. Model description
This deep network model provides the automatic
classification of input segments through an end-to-end
structure without the need for any hand-made feature

extraction or selection steps.
The deep network structure is composed of an
arrangement based on the VGG-16 network [8], where the
feature extraction stages (convolutions) are duplicated and
arranged in parallel.

and average loss. The un-official S-score challenge was
also computed [5] to assess the proposed parallel model
effectiveness and reliability for the CAs identification.
Although the dataset size is large, it is necessary to carry
out the 10-folds cross-validation technique to stabilize the
statistical model performance.

3. Results

Figure 2. The architecture of the classification model
developed.

The results of the implementation of the proposed
model are shown. Also, a comparison of evaluation metrics
is made with different training parameters tested to find the
best model.
The cross-validation method of 10-folds was carried out
to assess the model. In the local testing process, an F1 score
of 82.5% was reached with a loss of 0.0617 and an
unofficial S-score of 76.56%.

3.1. Model optimization
This allows entry of the two independently constructed
image sets. At the end of this arrangement, an FC network
takes the output of convolution/pooling and predicts the
best label to describe the image. The designed parallel
CNNs model is shown in Fig. 2.
The network input size parameters were modified to
support the two sets of 64 x 64 grayscale images used as
input of the model modified. During the training, the 120
images constructed per patient of each of the classes pass
through two 64 x 64 x 64 convolutional layers in the input
layer and later through a max-pooling layer. The
information is subsequently transferred to the following
general layers. The second layer consists of two
convolutional layers and one max-pooling layer. The next
general layers are composed of three convolutional layers
(see model characteristics in Fig. 2). At the end of the
convolution layers of each available layer, there is a maxpooling layer. In convolutional layers are used filters with
a kernel size of 3 x 3 and in the max-pooling layers a kernel
size of 2 x 2.
After the five general layers of parallel CNNs, there is a
FC of three layers with a different architecture. The first
layer of FC receives the 4096 features obtained. The last
layer, called a sigmoid layer, contains 27 channels, and it
is in charge of classifying 27 labels (one for each class, see
network configuration in Fig. 2). Finally, the network gives
the signal probability to present each of the 27 CAs to
identify a CA.

2.5.

Model evaluation

The proposed method was applied to the set of datasets
obtained. Some parameters were calculated from the
classification results with the designed model: the F1 score

For the optimization of the CNN, model parameters
such as learning rate and the batch size are taking into
account. The step of model parameter optimization is
indispensable to achieve the best classification
performance.

A set of variations in the batch size value was carried
out to assess the proposed model's best performance. The
batch size was modified five times, and the learning rate
was automatically updated in the training process.
The number of epochs was set in 50. As a result, it was
found that the best batch size value for the training process
was 512. A lower loss and a higher overall F1 score were
observed (see Tab. 1).

Comparison with other models

As an additional test, the classification of the CAs was
performed by implementing two other widely-used CNNs
to compare them with the proposed model.

From the results, it was observed that although the
training time of the model proposed here is longer than that
of Resnet-50 and that the VGG-19 network is more robust
than the VGG-16, the evaluation of test signals gives a very
accurate result with modified VGG-16 (see the comparison
in Tab. 2).

4. Discussion
The comparison of results was performed using only
TFR images, only the raw data images, and both. Using
only the TFR images, an F1 score of 76 +/- 2 was obtained
and with the raw images of 66 +/- 3. For this reason, it was
convenient to place them in parallel. Putting them in
parallel allowed obtaining feature patterns in a time
window as doctors do. At the same time, the features in the
time-frequency window were extracted from their
instantaneous energy.
The classification interferences found were mainly
attributed to the morphology similarity between the
different kinds of cardiac abnormalities present in the
dataset, despite the class size difference. This characteristic
in the classification makes this model suitable for
unbalanced classes. However, it needs to be improved to
differentiate between classes with similar characteristics
properly. The realization of these adjustments in the
classification methodology is proposed as future work
presented here.

arrhythmia with 2-D images and the VGG-16 model would
be a practical approach to detecting CAs from 12-leads
ECG signals. It is important to mention that this approach,
with its encouraging results, will be verified very soon with
the private dataset that is hosted on Physionet servers [5].

5. Conclusion
In this paper, our team UIDT-UNAM proposed a useful
CAs classification model using a parallel CNN with ECG
images based on the VGG-16 network. As an input, two
sets of 64 x 64 grayscale images were transformed from
dataset ECG records. Over 37134 12-leads ECG records
were processed, and near to 4456080 ECG beat images
were obtained with 26 types of CAs and the normal
rhythm. The optimized CNN model was designed with
considering essential concepts such as 10-fold crossvalidation. As a result, our proposed scheme achieved
91.57% SP, 82.50% F1-score, and 76.60% S-score. Our
ECG classification result indicates that the identification of
