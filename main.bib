  abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a commonly used tool for detecting cardiac abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation, blocks, and irregular complexes. For the Phy- sioNet/CinC 2020 Challenge, we built an algorithm using gradient boosted tree ensembles fitted on morphology and signal processing features to classify ECG diagnosis.  For each lead, we derive features from heart rate vari- ability, PQRST template shape, and the full signal wave- form. We join the features of all 12 leads to fit an ensem- ble of gradient boosting decision trees to predict probabil- ities of ECG instances belonging to each class. We train a phase one set of feature importance determining models to isolate the top 1,000 most important features to use in our phase two diagnosis prediction models. We use re- peated random sub-sampling by splitting our dataset of 43,101 records into 100 independent runs of 85:15 train- ing/validation splits for our internal evaluation results.  Our methodology generates us an official phase valida- tion set score of 0.476 and test set score of -0.080 under the team name, CVC, placing us 36 out of 41 in the rankings.},

  abstract = {The subject of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 was the identification of cardiac abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. A total of 66,405 recordings were sourced from hospital systems from four distinct countries and annotated with clinical diagnoses, including 43,101 annotated recordings that were posted publicly. For this Challenge, we asked participants to design working, open-source algorithms for identifying cardiac abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings. This Challenge provided several innovations. First, we sourced data from multiple institutions from around the world with different demographics, allowing us to assess the generalizability of the algorithms. Second, we required participants to submit both their trained models and the code for reproducing their trained models from the training data, which aids the generalizability and reproducibility of the algorithms. Third, we proposed a novel evaluation metric that considers different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, reflecting the clinical reality that some diagnoses have similar outcomes and varying risks. Over 200 teams submitted 850 algorithms (432 of which successfully ran) during the unofficial and official phases of the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches from both academia and industry for identifying cardiac abnormalities. The official phase of the Challenge is ongoing.Competing Interest StatementThis research is supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and AliveCor, Inc. under unrestricted gifts.

  abstract = "Time series feature engineering is a time-consuming process because scientists and engineers have to consider the multifarious algorithms of signal processing and time series analysis for identifying and extracting meaningful features from time series. The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications."

  abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

  abstract={The role of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in clinical practice is limited by the accuracy of existing models. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80% and specificity over 99%. These results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.}

  abstract = "Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units."
