  abstract = "Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) began in the 1950s when conversion of its analog signal to digital form became available. Since then, automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer makes its own errors—sometimes critical—in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available."

ECGs are used in diagnosis, risk-stratification management decision-making, and assessment in response to therapy. The correct interpretation of 12 lead ECG recordings is complex and clinically challenging with misinterpretation having the potential to result in poor outcomes or even patient fatality. Despite its widespread use, several studies have highlighted deficiencies in ECG interpretation skills among health professionals. The literature suggests that up to 33% of ECG interpretations have some error when compared to the expert reference and up to 11% resulted in inappropriate management. The pedagogy of ECG interpretation lacks universal establishment; time allocation, faculty training and teaching format vary considerably within the literature. This review of the literature reports how a lack of established ECG reporting methods may contribute to the variation in reported ECG interpretation competence across many healthcare professionals. The ubiquity of the ECG in clinical practice and an over reliance on computer assisted ECG interpretation are additionally explored as factors affecting acquisition and retention of this clinical skill."

  abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a commonly used tool for detecting cardiac abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation, blocks, and irregular complexes. For the Phy- sioNet/CinC 2020 Challenge, we built an algorithm using gradient boosted tree ensembles fitted on morphology and signal processing features to classify ECG diagnosis.  For each lead, we derive features from heart rate vari- ability, PQRST template shape, and the full signal wave- form. We join the features of all 12 leads to fit an ensem- ble of gradient boosting decision trees to predict probabil- ities of ECG instances belonging to each class. We train a phase one set of feature importance determining models to isolate the top 1,000 most important features to use in our phase two diagnosis prediction models. We use re- peated random sub-sampling by splitting our dataset of 43,101 records into 100 independent runs of 85:15 train- ing/validation splits for our internal evaluation results.  Our methodology generates us an official phase valida- tion set score of 0.476 and test set score of -0.080 under the team name, CVC, placing us 36 out of 41 in the rankings.},

  abstract = {The subject of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 was the identification of cardiac abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. A total of 66,405 recordings were sourced from hospital systems from four distinct countries and annotated with clinical diagnoses, including 43,101 annotated recordings that were posted publicly. For this Challenge, we asked participants to design working, open-source algorithms for identifying cardiac abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings. This Challenge provided several innovations. First, we sourced data from multiple institutions from around the world with different demographics, allowing us to assess the generalizability of the algorithms. Second, we required participants to submit both their trained models and the code for reproducing their trained models from the training data, which aids the generalizability and reproducibility of the algorithms. Third, we proposed a novel evaluation metric that considers different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, reflecting the clinical reality that some diagnoses have similar outcomes and varying risks. Over 200 teams submitted 850 algorithms (432 of which successfully ran) during the unofficial and official phases of the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches from both academia and industry for identifying cardiac abnormalities. The official phase of the Challenge is ongoing.Competing Interest StatementThis research is supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and AliveCor, Inc. under unrestricted gifts.

The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications."

  abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

  abstract = "Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units."

This paper investigates the multi-label, multi-class classification of ECG records into one or more of 27 possible medical diagnoses. Our multi-step approach uses conventional physiological algorithms for segmentation of heartbeats from the baseline signals. We stack a heartbeat autoencoder over heartbeat windows to make embeddings, then we encode this sequence of embeddings to make an ECG embedding which we then classify on. We utilize the public dataset of 43,101 available ECG records provided by the PhysioNet/CinC 2020 challenge, performing repeated random subsampling and splitting the available records into 80\% training, 10\% validation, and 10\% test splits, 20 times. We attain a mean test split challenge score of 0.248 with an overall macro F1 score of 0.260 across the 27 labels.},

Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.},

However, there is also a single anatomically ordered sequence of leads, called the Cabrera display that presents the six frontal plane leads in their anatomically ordered sequence of: aVL, I, −aVR, II, aVF, and III. Although it has been recognized that the Cabrera system has clinical diagnostic advantages compared to the classical display, it is currently only used in Sweden. The primary explanation of why the Cabrera system has not been adopted internationally has been that analog ECG recorders had technical limitations. Currently, however, the classical system is most often seen as a historical remnant that prevails because of conservatism within the cardiology community.},

Relevant studies were pooled using random effects meta-analysis for risk of mortality, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Sensitivity analyses were performed considering the population type and the use of adjustments.Results Our search yielded 14 studies that were undertaken between 1972 and 2011 with 400 750 participants. Among the studies that adjusted for potential confounders, the pooled results suggest an increased risk of mortality with prolonged PR interval risk ratio (RR) 1.24 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.51, five studies. Prolonged PR interval was associated with significant risk of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (RR 1.39 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.65, three studies) and atrial fibrillation (RR 1.45 95\% CI 1.23 to 1.71, eight studies) but not cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction or stroke or TIA. Similar observations were recorded when limited to studies of first-degree heart block.Conclusions Data from observational studies suggests a possible association between prolonged PR interval and significant increases in atrial fibrillation, heart failure and mortality. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the relationships reported, consider possible mechanisms and define the optimal monitoring strategy for such patients.},

    abstract = "{PROLONGATION of the QT interval, either on a congenital or an acquired basis, is associated with an increased likelihood of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.1-3 Patients with QT prolongation frequently develop recurrent attacks of syncope or may present with sudden death. The malignant ventricular arrhythmias are characterized by rapid, irregular tachycardias that usually have a polymorphous configuration or a torsades de pointes pattern. The latter is a French term that describes the tachycardia as a "twisting of the points," so called because the QRS axis shifts back and forth around the baseline. Although polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and torsade frequently occur in the setting of QT prolongation, these malignant arrhythmias may also occur in the absence of a repolarization abnormality. Effective cardiac output and blood pressure are markedly impaired during torsades de pointes, with resultant syncope. Most tachyarrhythmic episodes terminate spontaneously with return of consciousness, but some may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation,}",

    abstract = {Abstract Background: Q waves developed in the subacute and persisting into the chronic phase of myocardial infarction (MI) usually signify myocardial necrosis. However, the mechanism and significance of Q waves that appear very early in the course of acute MI (<6 h from onset of symptoms), especially if accompanied by ST elevation, are probably different. Hypothesis: This study assesses the prognostic implications of abnormal Q waves on admission in 2,370 patients with first acute MI treated with thrombolytic therapy <6 h of onset of symptoms. Results: Patients with abnormal Q waves in ≥2 leads with ST-segment elevation (n = 923) were older than patients without early Q waves (n = 1,447) (60.6 ±11.9 vs. 58.8 ±11.9 years, respectively; p = 0.0003), and had a greater incidence of hypertension (34.3 vs. 30.5\% p = 0.05) and anterior MI (60.6 vs. 41.1 \% p<0.0001). Time from onset of symptoms to therapy was longer in patients with Q waves upon admission (208 ± 196 vs. 183 ± 230 min; p = 0.01). Peak serum creatine kinase (2235 ± 1544 vs. 1622 ± 1536 IU; p<0.0001), prevalence of heart failure during hospitalization (13.8 vs. 7.0\%, p<0.0002), hospital mortality (8.0 vs. 4.6\% p = 0.02), and cardiac mortality (6.6 vs. 4.5\%, p = 0.11) were higher in patients with anterior MI and with abnormal Q waves than in those without abnormal Q waves upon admission. There was no difference in peak creatine kinase, prevalence of heart failure, in-hospital mortality, and cardiac mortality between patients with and without abnormal Q waves in inferior MI. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that mortality is independently associated with presence of Q waves on admission (odds ratio 1.61; 95\% CI 1.04–2.49; p = 0.04 for all patients; odds ratio 1.65; 95\% CI 0.97–2.83; p=0.09 for anterior wall MI. Conclusion: Abnormal Q waves on the admission electrocardiogram (ECG) are associated with higher peak creatine kinase, higher prevalence of heart failure, and increased mortality in patients with anterior MI. Abnormal Q waves on the admission ECG of patients with inferior MI are not associated with adverse prognosis.},

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80\% and specificity over 99\%. These results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.},
