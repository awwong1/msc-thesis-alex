% U. of A. THESIS DOCUMENT STYLE
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% REVISION HISTORY %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Version 0.8  -- November 1987  for LaTeX version 2.09
%	Author: Fahiem Bacchus with many macros taken from 
%                       Leslie Lamport REPORT document style.
% Version 0.9  -- November 1992 for LaTeX version 2.09
%	Updated by: Randal Peters
%
% Version 0.95 -- October 1995  for LaTeX2e and LaTeX version 2.09
%	Rewritten by: Narendra Ravi
%        : Works with both LaTeX2e and LaTeX 2.09 versions.
%        : Has a Completely modified/new interface.
%
% 	- Modified file to work with LaTeX2e and LaTeX 2.09
% 	- commented \supervisor, \external, and \chair macros
% 	  (FGSR changed their minds -- what else is new?)
% 	- "(Examiner)" removed from signature line. 
% 	- "(Signed)" removed from release page.
% 	- minor typographical changes to prefatory pages
% 	  (removing CAPITALIZATION, adding bold face in some
% 	  cases where larger fonts used to be).
% 	- Changes to the style to take care of the Department and
% 	  the Field of specialization.
% 	- Currently the spacing has to be managed manually. Code
% 	  to automate this will be added later. Use the following
% 	  command after \bodyoftext:
%      		\singlespacing      % single spacing; \baselineskip is 1em
%		\onehalfspacing     % One and a half spacing;
%      		\doublespacing      % double spacing; \baselineskip is 1.75em
%      		\truedoublespacing  % true double spacing; \baselineskip is 2em
%
% Version 1.00 -- November 1999	for LaTeX2e and LaTeX version 2.09
% 	Updated by: Diego Novillo
% 	Corrected typo in library release form.
% 	Made each prefatory page go on a separate page.
% 	Modified margins and signature page to conform to FGSR
% 	regulations as of November 1999.
% 	Minor source formatting changes
%
% Version 1.10 -- January 2000
% 	Updated by: Diego Novillo
% 	Re-introduced \supervisor, \cosupervisor and \external
% 	fields. FGSR wants these fields back.
%
%
% Martha White, Chris Rayner, Mike Smit made some changes along the way.
%
% Version 1.15 -- October 2014
%   Updated by Rick Valenzano and John Hawkin
%   Changed the title page to mimic the sampled given by FGSR.
%   Fixed the line numbering to use lower case roman numerals before
%   the thesis body and then arabic numerals in the rest starting with
%   1 on the first page.
%   Also got rid of a lot of functionality that was no longer used to make
%   things cleaner.
%
% Version 2.0 -- September 2017
%   Updated by Bernard Llanos
%   The following change list applies to all files included with this template,
%   not only to this file:
%   - Put the thesis template into Git source control, so that changes can be
%     tracked through Git from now on.
%   - Added Unicode support
%   - Bibliography with back references (can be turned off - This is mainly
%     something to help with editing)
%   - Improved support for appendices
%   - Introduced a modular document structure, rather than leaving it up to the
%     user to figure out how to split their thesis into manageable pieces.
%     (This is mainly to help novice LaTeX users.)
%   - Looked through FGSR minimum formatting guidelines to make sure the template
%     still conforms to them.
%
% Version 2.1 -- September 2019
%   Updated by Bernard Llanos
%   - Template updated based on changes in my M.Sc. thesis. The thesis has been
%     approved by the FGSR, so this template should meet the current formatting
%     requirements.
%   - Changed package used for cross-referencing between files.
%   - Added support for a glossary
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% How to Use This style file??
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% LaTeX 2.09 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% To use with LaTeX 2.09, simply change your documentstyle command
% to one of the following:
%   \documentstyle[uathesis,twoside]{report}	% for double-sided printers
%   \documentstyle[uathesis]{report}		% for single-sided printers
%   \documentstyle[10pt,uathesis]{report}		% for 10pt format
%   \documentstyle[11pt,uathesis]{report}		% for 11pt format
%   \documentstyle[12pt,uathesis]{report}		% for 12pt format
%
% Make sure uathesis is the last option loaded.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%
% LaTeX2e %
%%%%%%%%%%%
% To use with LaTeX2e, use the following:
%   \documentclass{report}          % for default format
%   \documentclass[10pt]{report}    % for 10pt format, default actually
%   \documentclass[11pt]{report}    % for 11pt format
%   \documentclass[12pt]{report}    % for 12pt format
%
% Then use
%
%   \usepackage{...}
%   \usepackage{...}
%   \usepackage{...}
%   \usepackage{uathesis}
%   \usepackage{xmpincl}
%
% Make sure these are the last packages loaded. The last one is for PDF/A 
% conversion. It seems to be necessary on Macs, not sure if it is needed elsewhere.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%
% Example %
%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Refer to 'thesis.tex' for a minimum working example of a document
% using this style.
