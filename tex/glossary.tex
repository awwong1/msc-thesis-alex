This is a sample glossary entry.

Glossary entry descriptions can span multiple paragraphs.

Remember that glossaries are optional.
The glossary implementation in this template is intended to be simple, and makes use of only one package, \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/glossaries}{\texttt{glossaries}}. There are more flexible, and fully-featured methods for creating glossaries than the one used here.
