\begin{preface}
A preface is required if you need to describe how parts of your thesis were
published or co-authored, and what your contributions to these sections were.
Also mention if you intend to publish parts of your thesis,
or have submitted them for publication. 
It is also required if ethics approval was needed for any part of the thesis.

Otherwise it is optional.

See the FGSR requirements for examples of how this can look.
