I am grateful for my supervisor, Dr. Abram Hindle, for his invaluable mentoring, guidance, and support throughout my academic journey.

This research was supported by an Alberta Excellence Graduate Scholarship and a Graduate Research Assistant Fellowship provided by the Canadian VIGOUR Centre.

I am grateful to my parents, Andrew and Amy, for the privileged life and many opportunities that I have as a result of their hardship.
I am especially thankful for my partner, Bonnie, who has provided endless support and instilled in
me the three traits that continue to guide my life: to remain genuine; to be ambitious; and to stay grateful.
