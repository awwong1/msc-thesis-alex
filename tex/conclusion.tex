\label{chp:conclusion}

In this thesis, I proposed three approaches for the classification of 12-lead \gls{ecg} records.
I demonstrated that \gls{ecg} records can be classified using traditional signal processing and feature extraction techniques in combination with a shallow gradient boosted tree ensemble algorithm (Chapter~\ref{chp:xgbensemble}).
I showcased a deep learning \gls{ecg} record classifier using beat to sequence autoencoders to learn fixed length embeddings from arbitrary length signals (Chapter~\ref{chp:dl_autoenc}).
I proposed a set of experiment configurations, experimenting on the original shallow gradient boosted tree ensemble methodology with labelwise feature pruning and incoporating the autoencoder embedding representations into the classifier inputs~(Chapter~\ref{chp:aencxgb}).

All three approaches described in this thesis are capable of predicting multiple cardiac diagnoses from unstructured, 12-lead \gls{ecg} records.
Specific to the \emph{PhysioNet/CinC 2020 Challenge}, our most prominent approach selects the label-wise top 1000 most important features and autoencoder embeddings from the entire input space of features and trains an XGBoost binary classifier for each of our 27 diagnoses.
This approach achieves an average test split challenge score of $0.4366$, with an overall test split classification accuracy of $0.3068$.

\section{Future Work}
The biggest unrealized gain in the classification of \gls{ecg} records using the \emph{PhysioNet/CinC} provided public data is for a human expert to overread and correct all erroneous labels and discard unusable samples from the available corpus.
This can also be addressed by augmenting the available corpus of data with new \gls{ecg} records that are sourced from known distributions and labelled by trusted cardiologists.
Because the \emph{PhysioNet/CinC 2021 Challenge} extends the current challenge and incorporates a 2-lead classification variant, a replication of this study using a subset of 2 leads is also warranted.

For use as a general \gls{ecg} classifier, the success of the wide and deep transformer architecture proposed by Natarajan \emph{et al}~\cite{natarajan2020CINC-multilabel-ECG} emphasizes the importance of the transformer family of neural networks,
When trained on the raw signal and a selection of manually engineered features, transformers may result in superior classifiers than approaches using convolutions, recurrent neural networks, and shallow classifiers alone.

The classification of \gls{ecg} records in this thesis were limited to the 27 labels defined by the PhysioNet challenge organizers.
Future work should tailor the multi-label multi-class classification task to incorporate a more broad scope of cardiac diagnoses, or explore matching diagnoses to high dimensional embedding space as an alternative to discrete binary classifiers per label.
