\chapter{Conclusion}

% Referring back to the introduction (Section \ref{sec:crossRef}), we see
that cross-references between files are correctly handled when the files
are compiled separately, and when the main document is compiled.
When the main document is compiled, cross-references are hyperlinked.
The values of the cross-references will change between the two compilation
scenarios, however. (Each chapter, compiled on its own, becomes ``Chapter 1''.)

\begin{note}[Caution:]
For cross-references to work, when files are compiled separately,
the referenced file must be compiled at least once before the
referring file is compiled.
